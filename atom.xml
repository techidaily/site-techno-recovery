Move it to your<strong>Inbox</strong> when you find it.</li><li>Search the<strong>Spam</strong> ,<strong>Trash</strong> , and<strong>All Mail</strong> folders for emails. Select<strong>More</strong> in the menu to access all folders and tabs.</li><li>The Gmail Message Recovery Tool might also be useful for recovering emails deleted in the last 30 days.</li></ul><p> Whether you accidentally deleted the emails or if they disappeared for some unknown reason, follow these instructions to retrieve your missing Google emails.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-My-Gmail-Messages-Missing"><a href="#Why-Are-My-Gmail-Messages-Missing" class="headerlink" title="Why Are My Gmail Messages Missing?"></a>Why Are My Gmail Messages Missing?</h2><p> There are a few reasons why Gmail messages may be lost. The most common reason is that you accidentally moved or deleted them, but forwards and filters can also cause emails to disappear.</p><p> This guide applies only if you access Gmail from a web browser. Unique problems could be in play if you’re using Gmail in Outlook. For those solutions, check out our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-outlook-not-receiving-email-4177911" >tips for fixing Outlook when it’s not receiving emails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="How-to-Recover-Missing-Emails-in-Gmail"><a href="#How-to-Recover-Missing-Emails-in-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="How to Recover Missing Emails in Gmail"></a>How to Recover Missing Emails in Gmail</h2><p> There are a few ways to find missing emails. They might have gone to spam, been archived or deleted, or something else.</p><ol><li>Check your spam. It’s possible the missing email was caught by Gmail’s spam filter. Select<strong>Spam</strong> from the left menu pane. (You may have to scroll down and select<strong>More</strong> to see it.) If the missing email is in the Spam folder, select the checkbox next to it, then select<strong>Not spam</strong> .<br> Emails marked as Spam stay in the Spam folder for 30 days and then are permanently deleted. Once deleted, you will not be able to access the missing email.</li><li>Review deleted emails. It’s possible your missing email was accidentally sent to the trash. From the left menu pane, select<strong>Trash</strong> or<strong>More</strong> &gt;<strong>Trash</strong> . If you find the email, right-click it (or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-select-multiple-messages-quickly-in-gmail-1172037" >select multiple messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary) and choose<strong>Move to inbox</strong> .<br> Emails sent to the Trash folder are permanently deleted after 30 days. If you deleted an email more than 30 days ago, it is gone forever.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-retrieve-archived-emails-in-gmail-4165955" >Check the All Mail folder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This folder shows everything in your email account, including archived mail and the contents of the Social, Updates, Forums, and Promotions tabs (but excluding emails in Spam and Trash). Click and drag an email to move it to the Inbox folder.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-search-mail-in-gmail-1172081" >Search for the email <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The missing Gmail message might be buried beneath other emails. You can search for anything that might help: the subject, recipient, original sender, date, or body text.<br> Open a specific folder first and then trigger the search if you think you know where the missing email is located.</li><li>Review your filters if<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/auto-filter-gmail-messages-1616958" >Gmail is set up to automatically filter incoming messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . A filter could block emails, send them to the trash, or move them into folders. This can give the illusion that the emails are missing or deleted when, really, they’re just tucked away out of view.<br> It’s easy to forget about filters. To see your filters, open Gmail’s settings to the<strong>Filters and Blocked Addresses</strong> tab.</li><li>Check the forwarding account if you’re<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-forward-gmail-email-using-filters-1171934" >forwarding emails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This feature lets you automatically send emails to another email account. This means it’s possible the other account still has your missing emails.<br> If you’re not sure if this is set up for your account, head over to Gmail’s settings and select the<strong>Forwarding and POP&#x2F;IMAP</strong> tab. Any forwarding addresses will appear at the top of the screen. Delete those you do not wish to forward to.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/mail/workflow/9317561" >Use the Gmail Message Recovery Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If none of the above tips have worked to find the email, Google’s recovery tool could be helpful. Although the service is typically reserved for hacked accounts or when an email has been maliciously deleted, it can sometimes dig up lost emails.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-gmail-issues-4570926" >Gmail Issues? Here’s How to Fix Them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Why are emails I’ve moved missing from their folders?<br> There are several causes for previously saved emails to disappear. It could be a device syncing issue or filters accidentally mis-filing or deleting messages. If you share a Gmail account, it’s also possible that someone else has moved or deleted those messages accidentally.</li><li>What do I do if my sent emails are missing?<br> Missing sent emails could be caused by a server issue, browser problems, or possibly a filter that’s mistakenly deleting messages once they’re sent. Try restarting the Gmail or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980" >clearing your browser’s cache <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.

console to contemplate. Thanks to games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder, it has all the big Nintendo franchises you’re likely to have grown up with. Such games are charming and sure to appeal to kids of all ages. Many also have features that mean you can help younger kids figure out what to do. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is also perfect for giving the whole family something to play together and love. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6M_NvPRNXx78hGqLuY52z6aGlhE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SwitchOLED3-3b4f85e832384f51b5c171e07a4daa65.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch OLED handheld gaming console."                > </p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p> The console is a little delicate for younger hands but highly versatile. You can use it as a handheld console with its 7-inch OLED screen looking sharp and crisp (if offering lower resolutions than the PS5 or Xbox Series X), but you can also dock it with your TV so the whole family can gather around. You can detach the console’s Joy-Con controllers, so you don’t need to buy additional controllers for the first two players.</p><p> If you want a games console the whole family can enjoy, the Nintendo Switch OLED is a good choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB0CL5KNB9M" >  Sony PlayStation 5 Slim  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB0CL5KNB9M"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0e2N5WR_TNPrJTmb1hX_Gy0L3oM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/PlayStation5consoleslim-2004698b8bb84b1dbe74dfd10d2bef39.jpg"                      alt="PlayStation 5 console (slim)."                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Amazon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB0CL5KNB9M" > $449 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Disc-Console-Slim/5113183756?slpfid=3" > $499 at Walmart  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-5-slim-console-white/6566039.p?skuId=6566039" > $500 at Best Buy  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Powerful hardware</li><li>Many great exclusive games</li><li>One of the best controllers</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>You need to pay for most online multiplayer</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> The latest revision of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" > Sony PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-slim-7966360" > Sony PlayStation 5 Slim <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is a good console choice for older kids who can play more mature games. Certain games like The Last of Us and God of War franchises are still too old for them (but perfect for you to sneak a go). Still, there are more appropriate games like the Uncharted series or Gran Truism 7 to entertain the kids with fantastic graphics and visual flourishes. </p><p> The console is straightforward to use, with a straightforward user interface that makes finding what you’re doing simple. Separate from the games is a media section for streaming apps, where you can also watch 4K Blu-rays if you wish. It works well as an all-in-one entertainment unit for the older child in your life. </p><p> One highlight is the PS5’s DualSense controller, which feels great. With haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, you feel more part of the game than with other regular controllers. I loved swinging through New York City in Marvel’s Spider-Man games; the triggers made me feel more in control. </p><p> The only downside is that the Sony PlayStation 5 is pretty expensive.

It’s hefty, so you’ll need to find room for it (or you could always opt for the less powerful but much smaller Xbox Series S), but it’s sure to be a hit with the kids.

That’s where the Backbone One for iPhone 15 Series &amp; Android (USB-C) PlayStation Edition comes in. It is the ideal accessory to solve the awkwardness of using your phone’s touchscreen to control the action. If you’re heading on a trip and want to entertain the kids, hand over your phone and slot this controller accessory onto it.</p><p> Besides hundreds of mobile games, you can also use it to stream from your PlayStation with PS Remote Play or use GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Streaming, extending your gaming options hugely. </p><p> Two sets of magnetic adapters mean it fits your phone well, while the D-pad and other buttons all feel good under your fingers. It’s also available with the standard ABXY buttons if you prefer. While it isn’t as good as using a regular games console or a dedicated portable device, it’s a relatively inexpensive way of turning your phone into a mobile gaming device when the opportunity arises.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-iOS/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB09ZXTRKQ9" >  Backbone One PlayStation Edition (Lightning)  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-iOS/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB09ZXTRKQ9"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xTm2NUbnF2d4kefXLXx9cOrc7Ao=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/backbone--one-playstation-edition-for-iphone-8dc9985b8a464a57b19dce153a3ec309.jpg"                      alt="Backbone One PlayStation Edition for iPhone"                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Backbone </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-iOS/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB09ZXTRKQ9" > $74 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/backbone-one-playstation-edition-lightning-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-white/6508655.p" > $100 at Best Buy  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one-playstation/" > View on Playbackbone.com  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works with older iPhones</li><li>Choice of models</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not as good as a regular games console</li><li>Not compatible with iPhone 15</li></ul><p> If you have an older iPhone and want to play games more enjoyably, you need the Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning). It works with all iPhones with a Lightning port, so we’re talking the iPhone 14 way back to the iPhone 6s. As with other Backbones, you can connect it to your phone via the magnetic adapters and turn it into a full controller. Pass it to your child while you’re traveling, and they’ll be delighted to play a game more regularly than if they played it solely on the phone.</p><p> As before, the Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning) works with all your iPhone’s games. That means Apple Arcade, games purchased on the App Store, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or PS Remote Play. Anything compatible with a controller will work here. It’s much more responsive and enjoyable to use than tapping the screen like you did before, and there’s a choice of models, either the PS way of doing things or ABXY. </p><p> The Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning) never feels as satisfying as a regular games console. Still, if you want a relatively inexpensive solution or your child will only game occasionally, it’s an excellent way to go compared to buying a new console.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08FC6C75Y" >  Sony DualSense Wireless Controller  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08FC6C75Y"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UAJxDlYdwq81WdqM9hlkLnhqZIM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sony-dualsense-wireless-controller-b6347d9842814995875dcb22d405ee10.jpg"                      alt="Sony DualSense Wireless Controller"                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Amazon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08FC6C75Y" > $53 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller/615549727" > $70 at Walmart  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-dualsense-wireless-controller-ps5/?slfpid=3" > View on Verizon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Haptic feedback (vibration) is great</li><li>Rear buttons can adjust to be easier or harder to press in response to gameplay</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Built-in mic isn’t great</li></ul><p> The PlayStation 5 already has one controller, but if you’re keen to gather the family around, you need to buy an extra Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller. It’s a worthwhile investment to stop the kids fighting over who gets to play next, with many co-op and local multiplayer games available for the PS5. </p><p> The Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller is more than just your average controller. It’s far more attractive to use. It has haptic feedback, an upgraded vibration that provides more accurate sensations to whatever you’re doing in-game.</p><p> It also has adaptive triggers, which can change the tension of the rear buttons to make it harder or easier to press in response to your gameplay. </p><p> You can squeeze it to feel more in control rather than just tapping the trigger buttons to swing something around or accelerate. It’s highly responsive and revolutionizes how gaming feels. In racing games like Gran Turismo 7, it almost means there’s no need for separate driving accessories, as you always feel in control. In games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, you can swing around NYC in a hugely satisfying way. </p><p> The Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller also has a built-in microphone for when you want to chat with friends while gaming. It’s not as good as a dedicated headset&#x2F;microphone setup, but it’s a good starting point for the odd occasion your child might be playing with friends. A dedicated share button is excellent for sharing clips and images of what you’re doing, too.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08ZNQN1FP?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08ZNQN1FP" >  Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08ZNQN1FP?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08ZNQN1FP"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ffHK-Wl9GjMDW1cSdkxMHBIDqHQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verizon-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-7234459ffb1640669ddb65742a0ed5d3.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller"                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Verizon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08ZNQN1FP?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08ZNQN1FP" > $46 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-wireless-controller/8XN59CRBSQGZ/JBFJ" > $45 at Microsoft  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://goto.target.com/LXkMvZ" > View on Target  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Available in many colors</li><li>Ergonomic design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Uses standard batteries rather than rechargeable</li></ul><p> The Xbox Wireless Controller needs to hurry up and be rechargeable rather than require you to have a pack of batteries ready all the time, but it’s otherwise pretty great. Its design molds into your hands well and is small enough to suit the hands of a child while still feeling comfortable in adult hands.</p><p> Available in many colors, you can soon ensure that every family member has a controller, cutting down on arguments over who gets what. There’s a pretty diverse range of options, too. The controller has the typical triggers and ABXY buttons, but there’s now a dedicated share button, which means you can tap it and then save screenshots or record clips of what’s just unfolded. It’s fun to share your victories or anything humorous that occurs. </p><p> Pretty much all controllers will pair with your PC, but the Xbox Wireless Controller does so in a much simpler manner than others. So, if you or your kids also play PC games, it works very well as a controller for both PC and Xbox. That’s excellent value for money in a gaming household.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PDFBJZD?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB07PDFBJZD" >  Logitech G Pro X  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PDFBJZD?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB07PDFBJZD"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AeIi0WzymPt25DsqQU-iKl88d6s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/logitech-g-pro-x-gaming-headset-2nd-generation-with-blue-voice-dts-headphone-71-and-50-mm-pro-g-drivers-for-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xsps5ps4-9991f573d1784bc48ed1447b0b227f8e.jpg"                      alt="Logitech G Pro X Gaming Headset"                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Amazon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PDFBJZD?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB07PDFBJZD" > $85 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-PRO-X-Gaming-Headset-Black/818998648?slfpid=3" > $85 at Walmart  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/logitech-pro-x-2-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-ps5-ps4-nintendo-switch-black/6544740.p?skuId=6544740" > $250 at Best Buy  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great sound quality</li><li>Comfortable design</li><li>Many wired connectivity options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Mic could be better</li><li>No app support for consoles</li></ul><p> There are many different gaming headsets around, and it’s essential to pick one that works for your particular console. While they all work with PC and often Switch (if they have a wired connection), you usually need a dedicated solution for PlayStation and one for Xbox. Once you’ve figured that out, give the Logitech G Pro X Wireless a go if you’re a PS4 or PS5 owner. It has a sturdy build but is incredibly comfortable, which isn’t always guaranteed, even with the best gaming headsets. </p><p> It has a built-in adjustable microphone, which works well, but the highlight is how good the Logitech G Pro X Wireless sounds. Connected via 3.5mm cords or through the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/external-digital-to-analog-converters-3134606" > USB DAC attachment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Logitech G Pro X Wireless doesn’t take long to set up, and both options prove useful. The 3.5mm option even means you can use it with your Xbox, although we recommend finding a wireless option. </p><p> However you listen, the Logitech G Pro X Wireless blocks out sound well thanks to its sound isolation functionality. It won’t block out the loudest noises, but your kids will still hear when you call their names for dinner. Ultimately, it’s a good option for ensuring your kids can enjoy some privacy, and you don’t have to keep hearing game sounds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Headset-One-Windows-Devices/dp/B08WFD42G5?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08WFD42G5" >  Xbox Wireless Headset  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Headset-One-Windows-Devices/dp/B08WFD42G5?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08WFD42G5"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WMA6rfU12wqk30vBB2gyWZT6i_0=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/XboxWirelessHeadset-d659742a7e7d4d1fb7f9bafaaa5f6b0a.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Wireless Headset."                > </a> </p><p>PHOTO: Amazon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Headset-One-Windows-Devices/dp/B08WFD42G5?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB08WFD42G5" > $78 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset" > View on Xbox.com  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No need for a dongle</li><li>Comfortable</li><li>Great bass</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Sound sometimes lags between console and headset</li></ul><p> For Xbox owners, the Xbox Wireless Headset is a good option for headphones. It’s affordable, so you won’t need to spend hundreds on it, and your kids will still enjoy having their own more immersive experience than relying on TV speakers. Refreshingly, the Xbox Wireless Headset has an equalizer that you or your child can adjust, and it’s all available within the Xbox Accessories app, which you likely already have installed.</p><p> Out of the box, the Xbox Wireless Headset sounds excellent with powerful bass, which lends itself well to the roar of an engine in Forza Horizon 5 or a bracing soundtrack in Halo Infinite. As needed, the Xbox Wireless Headset is comfy, so your child won’t mind wearing it for long periods. It can also handle the occasional toss-around. It can be a little small for adults, but that’s precisely why I like it for a child, as it won’t feel too big for them.</p><p> The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with six months of Dolby Atmos support as standard, which boosts its audio quality. The only downside is that latency can be a little low, i.e., the gap between when the game plays the music and when you hear it. It isn’t huge, so your child probably won’t notice, but if you’re looking for a headset that you will also use, you may find it slightly irritating.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/dp/B00Z0UWV98?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB00Z0UWV98" >  Logitech G920 Racing Wheel  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/dp/B00Z0UWV98?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB00Z0UWV98"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SlylJp2xFyJoi9-abbX6wANORvM=/fit-in/1500x975/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LogitechG920-5b5202c446e0fb005ba65262.jpg"                      alt="Logitech G920"                > </a> </p><p> PHOTO: Courtesy of Amazon </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/dp/B00Z0UWV98?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7CB00Z0UWV98" > $200 at Amazon  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-G920-Driving-Force-Racing-Wheel-For-Xbox-One-And-PC/49071785" > $220 at Walmart  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/logitech-g920-driving-force-racing-wheel-for-xbox-one-and-windows-black/4223402.p?" > $200 at Best Buy  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great force feedback</li><li>Truly immersive steering</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bulky to store</li><li>Pedals can feel stiff</li></ul><p> If your child loves to play racing games and you want them to learn the basics of driving for real, the Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Wheel is a fun and rewarding way to enhance the experience. The set is expensive but has foot pedals, so you get an almost true-to-life driving experience.</p><p> The steering feels great, and the 900 degrees of rotation ensure you’re always in complete control. It takes practice compared to using a game controller, but the ergonomics are excellent, and force feedback soon teaches you how to drive effectively. Whether you’re playing Gran Turismo 7 or Forza Motorsport, this is a great time. </p><p> Underneath the wheel are paddle shifters to select manual gears, while the pedals are well-built and provide clutch control and acceleration or braking. The pedals can sometimes be a little stiff, but arguably, so can car pedals. Regardless, if your child is passionate about driving for real, this is the closest opportunity they can grab for a while.</p><p> Got a PlayStation?

Sometimes, the remote unpairs with the streaming device even if you didn’t intentionally do that.</li><li>Check for obstructions. Bluetooth devices like the Fire Stick remote have a theoretical range of about 30 feet, but many things can reduce it.<br> If the remote only works when you hold it behind your TV or are very close to your TV, use a Fire Stick extender to reposition the device.<br> If your Fire TV device is inside a cabinet, remove it and try the remote again.<br> You may need a longer extension to move the Fire Stick out from behind the TV if the TV is mounted in a recess or an entertainment cabinet.</li><li>Check to see if you have any of the following devices anywhere near your Fire Stick:  <ul><li>Microwave ovens  </li><li>Wireless speakers  </li><li>Unshielded coaxial cables  </li><li>Wireless phones  </li><li>Wireless speakers  </li><li>Other wireless devices<br> Get your Amazon Fire device away from any of these devices.

The most common issues include battery problems, obstructions that block the signal from the remote, and interference from other electronics.</p><p> Here are the most common reasons for a Fire Stick remote to stop working:</p><ul><li><strong>Batteries:</strong> The most common reason Fire Stick remotes stop working is battery problems. Improperly inserted batteries, low battery charge, and other related issues can all cause a Fire Stick remote to stop working.</li><li><strong>Pairing:</strong> If your remote isn’t paired with your Fire Stick, it won’t work. Replacement remotes always need to be paired before you use them.</li><li><strong>Distance:</strong> Fire Stick remotes use Bluetooth, not infrared, so they have a theoretical range of about 30 feet. The actual number is typically lower.</li><li><strong>Obstructions:</strong> You don’t need a direct line of sight between your Fire Stick and remote, but obstructions can drastically reduce the range.</li><li><strong>Interference:</strong> Devices that interfere with Bluetooth connections can prevent your remote from working correctly.</li><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> If you’ve purchased a replacement remote for your Fire Stick, ensure they’re compatible.</li><li><strong>Damage:</strong> External damage, like water damage and internal faults due to failed components, can cause your Fire Stick remote to stop working.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-volume-not-working-on-firestick-remote-5198416" >How to Fix It When a Fire Stick Remote’s Volume Is Not Working <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>How do I unpair a Fire Stick remote?<br> To unpair a Fire Stick remote, you’ll first need to pair another Fire Stick remote. Using the new remote, go to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Controllers &amp; Bluetooth Devices</strong> &gt;<strong>Amazon Fire TV Remotes</strong> . Choose the remote you want to unpair, press the<strong>Menu</strong> (three lines) button, then<strong>Select</strong> to confirm unpairing.</li><li>How do I connect my Fire Stick to hotel Wi-Fi without a remote?<br> To<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/connect-firestick-to-hotel-wifi-without-remote-5201863" >connect a Fire Stick to hotel Wi-Fi without a remote <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , download the Fire TV mobile app onto one device and create a mobile hotspot on another.

Click<strong>Scan</strong> to start your scanning job.</p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>How do I scan a document to PDF format?<br> If you’re using Windows 10, open<strong>Windows Fax and Scan</strong> and select<strong>New Scan</strong> . Select the<strong>Profile</strong> drop-down, choose<strong>Document</strong> , then select the scanner type, such as<strong>Flatbed</strong> or<strong>Feeder</strong> . Select<strong>Scan</strong> . When your document finishes scanning, select<strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong>Print</strong> . Click the Printer drop-down and choose<strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> , then click<strong>Print</strong> and choose a save location. If you’re using a Mac, open a new<strong>Finder</strong> window and select<strong>Go</strong> &gt;<strong>Applications</strong> &gt;<strong>Image Capture</strong> . Select your scanner, scanner type, and destination folder. Select<strong>Format</strong> &gt;<strong>PDF</strong> , then click<strong>Scan</strong> .</li><li>How do I scan a document from my printer to my email?<br> Many scanners offer a scan-to-email function. For example, on a Brother printer, load and scan your document, as usual, then select<strong>Send Email</strong> . Configure your settings and click<strong>OK</strong> . Your default email program will send the scanned document. If your scanner doesn’t have this function, scan the document to PDF format (for the most flexibility), then save it to your desired location on your computer. Then, open your email program and send the scanned document or image as an attachment.</li><li>How do I scan a document with an iPhone?<br> Open the Notes app on your iPhone and create a new Note. Then tap the<strong>Camera</strong> icon and choose<strong>Scan Documents</strong> . Position the document in your camera’s view. Let Notes automatically focus and capture the image, or manually tap the<strong>shutter</strong> button. Drag the handles to crop the scan, then select<strong>Keep Scan</strong> when you’re finished.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-effective-thumbnails-the-secret-to-video-success/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Effective Thumbnails The Secret to Video Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-screencasting-team-virtual-gatherings/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Screencasting Team Virtual Gatherings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/a-beginners-guide-to-chatgpt-and-its-capabilities/"><u>A Beginner's Guide to ChatGPT and Its Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/chronicle-of-change-tracing-the-history-and-upgrades-from-ios-10-to-ios-et80/"><u>Chronicle of Change: Tracing the History and Upgrades From iOS 1.0 to iOS ˈeɪtʃ8.0</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/compre-written-explanation-easy-hdr-understanding/"><u>Compre Written Explanation Easy HDR Understanding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/decoding-the-differences-roku-express-vs-roku-stick-for-optimal-viewing-experience/"><u>Decoding the Differences: Roku Express vs Roku Stick for Optimal Viewing Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/easytech-snapshot-quick-rundown/"><u>EasyTech Snapshot Quick Rundown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-install-your-linksys-wusb6300-network-card-drivers-today/"><u>How to Get & Install Your Linksys WUSB6300 Network Card Drivers Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/inside-look-at-the-next-big-thing-in-gaming-the-xbox-vr-headset-specs-release-info-and-pricing-revealed/"><u>Inside Look at the Next Big Thing in Gaming: The Xbox VR Headset – Specs, Release Info & Pricing Revealed!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/is-the-fitbit-charge-3-worth-buying-comprehensive-review/"><u>Is the Fitbit Charge 3 Worth Buying – Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/resolving-the-msxml4dll-file-doesnt-exist-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Resolving the 'msxml4.dll File Doesn't Exist': A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-how-to-address-and-fix-coredll-not-found-problems/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: How to Address and Fix Core.dll Not Found Problems</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115945/19272" target="_top" id="2115945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115945/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The data cache might be taking up too much space or it could be outdated or corrupted. These things can cause the app to behave erratically or crash.</p><p> Often, you’ll know which app is acting up simply by its behavior. If this isn’t the case, start your cache-clearing with the browser, then move on to social media apps. Turn next to other apps that access the internet, then to those that occupy the most overall space.</p><p> Clearing cache is a temporary space-saving method. As you use an app, it will build up a new cache of temporary files.

As such, the performance and quality of a system are determined by the parts used in its construction.</p><p> So what is the difference between a store-bought system and a custom-built computer from parts? There could be almost no difference to a very significant difference based on the parts selected for the machine.</p><p> When purchasing a new PC, consider your skill level and budget. There are pros and cons to both decisions.</p><h2 id="Buying-a-PC-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Buying-a-PC-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Buying a PC: Pros and Cons"></a>Buying a PC: Pros and Cons</h2><p> Advantages</p><ul><li>No issues with hardware and software compatibility.</li><li>Better warranties.</li><li>Single point of contact for support issues.</li><li>Some software is pre-loaded.</li></ul><p> Disadvantages</p><ul><li>Tends to be higher in cost.</li><li>Less customization.</li><li>Less familiarity with internal components.</li></ul><h3 id="Advantages-of-Buying"><a href="#Advantages-of-Buying" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Buying"></a>Advantages of Buying</h3><p> For some, building a PC may be too complicated. One of the major benefits of buying a pre-made system is compatibility. The manufacturer ensures that the physical parts and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796" >drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work together to minimize performance issues.</p><p> Another important advantage of buying a PC is the warranty and support for the system. You typically have options for an advanced warranty, with some manufacturers covering accidental damage. This also means you have a single point of contact for warranty or support issues.</p><p> One more significant consideration when choosing to get a pre-built PC is that you don’t have to research individual components to ensure compatibility, quality, and other factors. The manufacturer often provides different configuration options to offer a flexible selection depending on your needs. Plus, you don’t have to be a technology guru to configure a new PC. If you’re unsure of the offerings, there’s usually a phone number or email to ask questions.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-computer-brands-4691899" >The 8 Best Computer Brands of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Disadvantages-of-Buying"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Buying" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Buying"></a>Disadvantages of Buying</h3><p> The major disadvantage of buying a pre-made PC is the cost. Generally, a computer that’s ready to go right off the shelf costs more than the homemade variety because manufacturers tend to use non-OEM parts. Retail computer parts can be higher in price, driving the end cost of a pre-made PC up as well. An exception to this rule is when there are sales on pre-built PCs. Many companies have exclusive sales during the holidays, such as Black Friday, or clearance sales to make room for new models. But, overall, it will cost you more to buy a ready-made computer.</p><p> If you like to know your computer intimately, purchasing a pre-built PC might not be the way to go. Since the manufacturer decides the components, you probably won’t do a ton of research to know each part in the system. With this, there will be less customization. So, if you want in-depth knowledge of your computer and need to fine-tune it to your needs, a pre-made system probably won’t serve you well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/seven-ways-to-save-money-on-a-computer-832356" >6 Ways to Save Money When Buying a Computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Building-a-PC-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Building-a-PC-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Building a PC: Pros and Cons"></a>Building a PC: Pros and Cons</h2><p> Advantages</p><ul><li>Customize components for your needs.</li><li>Have deeper knowledge of the parts in the PC.</li><li>Can be cheaper than a pre-built computer.</li><li>Customize for greater performance.</li></ul><p> Disadvantages</p><ul><li>No single point of contact for support.</li><li>Requires considerable research.</li><li>Novice users may struggle with the technical side of the build process.</li></ul><h3 id="Advantages-of-Building"><a href="#Advantages-of-Building" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Building"></a>Advantages of Building</h3><p> The most obvious advantage of building a computer from scratch is the selection of parts. Most computer systems come pre-built with the specifications and components selected for you. This often leads to consumers making compromises on features because a mass-produced system may not have all that you want or may offer a subpar component. By building your own computer, you can choose the parts that best match your desired setup. Some vendors do allow you to customize a computer system, but you are limited to their selection of parts.</p><p> Another thing to be aware of with pre-built systems is that two of the same model computer can have different parts. The reason for this is the suppliers, parts available at the time the system was built, and luck. For example, Dell might switch between multiple suppliers of memory because one is less expensive than the other. Similarly, they may swap hard drive brands if one has supply problems. Buying the parts yourself guarantees what ends up in your computer.</p><p> One of the less tangible advantages of building a computer from scratch is knowledge. You’ll learn and understand how the parts work together. This is valuable when troubleshooting computer problems. Knowing what components control the different sub-systems of a computer means you can repair hardware problems without dealing with support groups or expensive repair bills.</p><p> Finally, there is the cost. The more powerful your intended desktop computer, the more likely you can save money by building your own. This is because many premium components carry high markups by the manufacturers as a means to boost profits. While many of the small companies that build high-end systems may build a PC from the exact parts that you want, they mark up the price to cover the costs of building it and supplier support after the purchase.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-upgrade-on-pc-8423213" >What Should I Upgrade on My PC? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137213/26400" target="_top" id="2137213">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137213" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137213/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Disadvantages-of-Building"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Building" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Building"></a>Disadvantages of Building</h3><p> One of the biggest disadvantages of building a computer is the lack of a single support organization. Since each component likely comes from a different manufacturer, if a part has a problem, you’ll deal with the appropriate company. With pre-built systems, you only have to contact the manufacturer and their warranty service. This can also be an advantage in terms of building it yourself as a part failure is often quickly and easily resolved by replacing the part yourself rather than waiting for a large company to send out a technician or ship the system back to them.</p><p> Additionally, and this is a big one, choosing the parts to build a computer system can be a frustrating process. This is particularly true if you aren’t familiar with the technology and are building your first computer. You have to consider sizes, compatible components, wattages, and more technical stuff. If you don’t research things properly, you could end up with parts that don’t work well together or, at the very basic level, don’t even fit in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-computer-case-2618149" >computer case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you selected.</p><p> While cost is an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage. This is particularly true if you want to build a basic desktop computer. Manufacturers get discounts because they buy parts in bulk. And the budget market is competitive, which means it’s often cheaper to buy a basic computer for web browsing and productivity software than it is to build one. The cost savings may not be huge, maybe $50 to $100. Conversely, you can save hundreds over buying a PC if you look at a high-performance desktop PC. Low-cost pre-built systems can also leave much to be desired in the quality department.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/desktop-pc-buyers-guide-832343" >8 Things to Consider Before Buying a Desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118304/7443" target="_top" id="2118304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118304/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict-Know-Your-Needs-and-Skills"><a href="#Final-Verdict-Know-Your-Needs-and-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict: Know Your Needs and Skills"></a>Final Verdict: Know Your Needs and Skills</h2><p> If you don’t need a computer for a specialized task or high-end computing, a pre-made system may be the way to go, especially if you’re not technically minded.

Better yet, it’s an authorized reseller for major US carriers, so if you want to sign up for a new Verizon or AT&amp;T account, for instance, you can do it at Best Buy without ever needing to head to a carrier location.</p><p> Best Buy’s on-site staff is knowledgeable; the company gets new smartphones on launch days and often offers sales.</p><h2 id="Best-For-Budget-Shoppers"><a href="#Best-For-Budget-Shoppers" class="headerlink" title="Best For Budget Shoppers"></a>Best For Budget Shoppers</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=580000%7Cn5d01a1f3c50a457cb3caff73d05395db16%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hptZplQS0WaZyt4vdr4-Ox56Kfs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonLogo-5658ca845f9b5835e4585e34-8b9e2dbc3c1343789e0dcf95a2cd9a95.jpg" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=580000%7Cn5d01a1f3c50a457cb3caff73d05395db16%7C" >https://www.amazon.com/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=580000%7Cn5d01a1f3c50a457cb3caff73d05395db16%7C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=580000%7Cn5d01a1f3c50a457cb3caff73d05395db16%7C" >View on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good for finding affordable phones</li><li>Lots of useful filtering options to find what you want</li><li>Frequent limited-time deals</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Can’t easily compare multiple phones at once</li></ul><p> Amazon focuses on cheaper handsets that appeal to a mass audience of people on a budget who don’t like spending $1,000 on a new smartphone. And since most devices come with free shipping, you can quickly get your hands on a new phone from the company when you order online.</p><p> Interestingly, Amazon doesn’t have an exhaustive smartphone collection under the sun. Granted, the site allows you to find a slew of phones from companies like LG, Asus, and even several Chinese vendors, but if you’re looking for a brand-new iPhone or Samsung Galaxy device, Amazon is sometimes a little late to the game.</p><p> But if you’re looking for affordable smartphones, Amazon is well worth a look.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-to-buy-for-under-300-4045957" >Google Pixel 6 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Variety"><a href="#Best-for-Variety" class="headerlink" title="Best for Variety"></a>Best for Variety</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/" >Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/INyaly-AEw9qhVAD-4xquJxQf9s=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Walmart-5be5b97e46e0fb0026284141.jpg" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/" >https://www.walmart.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/" >View on Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Might be more affordable to shop here</li><li>Buy online or in the store</li><li>Wide selection</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Can’t sort by customer rating</li></ul><p> Walmart bridges the gap between Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p> Like Amazon, Walmart is a go-to spot for budget-friendly smartphones and basic cell phones. But it also sells new devices at the higher end of the spectrum, like Apple’s iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones. And since Walmart has some leverage in its negotiations with smartphone makers, you’ll often find that its devices are available at a slight discount compared to some of the competition.</p><p> Aside from that, Walmart is a top choice for convenience since the company has both an online presence and brick-and-mortar locations. And since its stores are in so many places, it shouldn’t be difficult to find what you want, when you want.</p><h2 id="Best-For-iPhones"><a href="#Best-For-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Best For iPhones"></a>Best For iPhones</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7xa9rMzYCBL0oapCII13v8Oia_M=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-5b6b0a9dc9e77c0082ace7c3-885d0079ec544ae4b2b92d76ce02d3f4.jpg" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/" >https://www.apple.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Apple</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/" >View on Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Preferrable for Apple fans</li><li>Helpful staff</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Limited to iPhones, unlike most retailers</li></ul><p> The Apple Store is the place to be if you’re an iPhone fan.</p><p> Apple has one of the best retail experiences in this roundup.

Buying them allows you to use your own SIM card and service.</li><li>What is the best place to buy used cell phones?<br> If you’re on a tight budget and don’t need the latest and greatest, a used phone is an excellent way to save some money. A good source for used phones is eBay. Sellers have to upload photos and should also list the device’s condition.

For Amazon Prime members, this is the biggest and best shopping event of the year. So, make sure you’re in-the-know and ready to go.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Amazon-Prime-Day"><a href="#What-Is-Amazon-Prime-Day" class="headerlink" title="What Is Amazon Prime Day?"></a>What Is Amazon Prime Day?</h2><p> Amazon created Amazon Prime Day to celebrate those who subscribe to the Amazon Prime service. They pay a yearly premium for things like free two-day shipping, streaming movies on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363" >Prime Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , songs in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-music-unlimited-and-amazon-prime-music-compared-4160098" >Amazon Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , books and magazines in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-reading-4160132" >Prime Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and additional features to make<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-amazon-prime-worth-it-8536157" >membership worth the price <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To show its appreciation to members, Amazon offers deep discounts and superb deals on products specifically for its Prime members on Amazon Prime Day.</p><p> Yes, you must be an Amazon Prime member to participate in the deals on Prime Day. If you’re not a Prime member, you can still purchase items, but not at the discounted prices.</p><h2 id="A-Quick-Glance-at-Prime-Day-History"><a href="#A-Quick-Glance-at-Prime-Day-History" class="headerlink" title="A Quick Glance at Prime Day History"></a>A Quick Glance at Prime Day History</h2><p> Amazon introduced Prime Day on July 15, 2015 in honor of its 20th birthday. Since then, it has become a yearly event that takes place in July.</p><p> One exception was in 2020, when Amazon shifted the event to October in 19 countries due to the COVID pandemic.  </p><p> If the previous years are an indication, Amazon Prime Day begins on the second Tuesday in July. However, this isn’t a guarantee; it’s just a pattern of past Prime Day events.</p><h2 id="How-Long-Does-It-Last"><a href="#How-Long-Does-It-Last" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does It Last?"></a>How Long Does It Last?</h2><p> In its first two years, 2015 and 2016, Amazon Prime Day lasted just one day. Beginning in 2017, Amazon extended the deals to cover two full days, and it has remained that way since, although the name, “Amazon Prime_Day_ ,” hasn’t changed.  </p><p> The event usually starts at 12:00 a.m. PDT (3:00 a.m. EDT) on the first day and ends at 11:59 p.m. PDT on the second, giving you a full 48 hours of shopping time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115913/19272" target="_top" id="2115913">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115913" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115913/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-Is-the-Next-Amazon-Prime-Day"><a href="#When-Is-the-Next-Amazon-Prime-Day" class="headerlink" title="When Is the Next Amazon Prime Day?"></a>When Is the Next Amazon Prime Day?</h2><p> In 2024, Prime Days will be held July 15 and 16.</p><p> Normally held in July, Amazon selects the exact days for Amazon Prime Day only about a month or two ahead of time. So, you’ll have to be on the lookout for the current year’s dates, and luckily, you have a few handy ways to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cgOy-hDm22bSxb7UP2I-HBae-B4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Prime-Day-Website-8649007-09004b1bb50a452b8f2425e004b7eeeb.jpeg"                      alt="Amazon Prime Day website"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Check your email</strong> : If you receive email notifications as a Prime member, check your inbox for the dates as the event grows closer.</li><li><strong>Visit the Prime Day website</strong> : You can visit the dedicated<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8649007%7Cn4c428fad6afd4614a500820e249a31c822%7C" >Prime Day website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for news on the event dates.</li><li><strong>Ask Alexa</strong> : For a hands-free way to stay in-the-know, you can also ask Alexa, “When is Amazon Prime Day?”</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip"><a href="#Tip" class="headerlink" title="Tip"></a>Tip</h3><p> You can set a reminder with Alexa for the event.

DND is a useful feature that enables you to silence sounds from calls, texts, and notifications when you don’t want to be bothered. You can turn on DND manually or schedule it, so be sure to check both options.<br> You can check for DND at a glance. If a moon icon appears in the upper-right corner of the home screen, DND is on. (On<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-x-4150706" >iPhone X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the moon icon appears only in Control Center.)<br> If you schedule DND, you may need to adjust the settings.</li><li>Unblock a blocked number. If someone says they called you, but there’s no sign of the call on your iPhone, you may have blocked that person’s number.

Fortunately, the fix is often simple. Follow these solutions in the order you see them here, which are ranked from least to most complex:</p><ol><li>Turn Wi-Fi on. It might seem obvious, but it’s easy to accidentally switch it off, and it takes just a few seconds to confirm if this is why the Surface Pro won’t connect to the internet.<br> To check, select the<strong>Wi-Fi icon</strong> next to the clock. If the tile is not highlighted, then Wi-Fi is off.

This is a useful feature, but only in very specific situations. When it’s on, this mode turns_off_ Wi-Fi.<br> Sometimes you can toggle Airplane Mode on and off to fix Wi-Fi problems. For example, if it’s already off, go ahead and switch it on for five seconds.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Expert-Advice-on-Repairing-Broken-Email-Functionality-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Expert-Advice-on-Repairing-Broken-Email-Functionality-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Expert Advice on Repairing Broken Email Functionality on Your iPhone"></a>Expert Advice on Repairing Broken Email Functionality on Your iPhone</h2><p> Your iPhone is your communications lifeline to the world, which is what makes it so frustrating when your iPhone email isn’t working. The good news is that there are several methods you can try to keep in touch from almost anywhere.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-iPhone-Email-That’s-Not-Working"><a href="#How-to-Fix-iPhone-Email-That’s-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix iPhone Email That’s Not Working"></a>How to Fix iPhone Email That’s Not Working</h2><p> There are many issues that can cause your iPhone email to not work properly. If you’re in this situation, we’ve 10 tips that can resolve the majority of iPhone email problems. Read on to learn about each one.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268" >Check iPhone network connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Your iPhone can’t get an email if it’s not connected to the internet. You need to be connected to a cellular network like a 4G LTE network through your phone company or a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-cant-connect-to-wifi-fix-1999602" >Wi-Fi network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to access email.<br> To connect to a cellular network, tap<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Cellular</strong> &gt; and move the<strong>Cellular Data</strong> slider to off&#x2F;white and then back to on&#x2F;green.<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/save-time-and-money-using-wifi-817904" >To connect to a Wi-Fi connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , turn on Wi-Fi in the iPhone Settings.<br> It’s also smart to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-iphone-airplane-mode-2000238" >make sure Airplane Mode isn’t turned on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Airplane mode can block connections to cellular and Wi-Fi networks.</li><li>Check email username and password. If your email isn’t sending or downloading, it could be that there’s a problem with the username and&#x2F;or password for that email account. In that situation, it’s most likely that you’ll get a pop-up window asking you to enter your username or password again.<br> If you don’t get that pop-up, you may want to remove the email account from your phone and set it up again. Check out the section on how to do that later in this article.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/quit-apps-on-iphone-2000287" >Close the app and relaunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . One quick way to fix an app that’s not working as expected is to quit the app and relaunch it. This may solve some problems that cause Mail not to work. When the Mail app is closed, tap the<strong>Mail</strong> app again to relaunch it.</li><li>Check email settings. Email accounts on the iPhone can be set to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/make-iphone-mail-check-for-new-mail-less-often-or-never-1172558" >check email on a schedule <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (every 30 minutes, for example) or to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-do-iphone-email-settings-do-2000086" >have mail pushed to your device as soon as it arrives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The settings you choose impact how your email arrives on your phone.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288" >Restart the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If your Internet connection is good, your settings fine, and you’ve restarted the Mail app, your next step is a common iPhone-troubleshooting measure: restarting your phone. Believe it or not, restarting an iPhone can solve tons of problems. Sometimes your phone just needs a fresh start.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293" >Up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293" >date iOS using iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-ios-on-iphone-connecting-itunes-1999188" >update iOS without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Another key troubleshooting step is to make sure you have the latest version of the iOS. Updated versions of the iOS deliver bug fixes and improvements to features. It’s possible that the problems with your email are the result of a bug that’s fixed with the latest iOS update or that your email provider has changed some settings and only the latest iOS version works with the change.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >D <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >elete the email account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >from your iPhone, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/add-email-account-to-iphone-4582835" >add the account to your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again. If none of these steps have helped and you’re still having iPhone email problems, there may not be anything wrong with your phone. Instead, the problem may be the settings you’re using. If you entered the wrong server address, username, or password when setting up the account on your phone, you won’t be able to get email. If that’s the case, delete the email account.<br> With the email account deleted from your phone, double check all the settings that you should use to access this account. Then go through the process of adding the email account to your iPhone again.</li><li>Contact your email provider for support. If your email still isn’t working, it’s time to get some direct tech support for your email problems. A good first step is to check with your email provider (Google for Gmail, Yahoo for Yahoo Mail, etc.). Each email provider has different ways to provide support, but a good bet is to log into your email account on the web and then look for links like Help or Support.</li><li>Get help directly from Apple. If your email provider can’t help, you may have a problem that’s bigger or more complex than you can solve. In that case, it’s probably best to take your iPhone — and all of the information about the email account — to your nearest Apple Store for tech support (you can also call Apple for support). Apple Stores are busy places, though, so<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/make-apple-store-appointment-with-app-1999600" >make an appointment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before heading out to make sure you get help.</li><li>If it’s a work account, check with your IT department. If you’re trying to check a work email account, it may be that the problem doesn’t lie with your iPhone at all. The problem might reside on the email server that you’re trying to get email from.<br> A temporary problem with that server or a configuration change that you’re not aware of could block your iPhone’s access. If the account that’s not working is provided by your job, check with your company’s IT department and see if they can help resolve the problem.</li></ol><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-behind-the-lens-on-your-macbook-webcam/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Behind the Lens on Your MacBook Webcam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-screen-look-examining-instagram-post-views/"><u>[Updated] Behind The Screen Look Examining Instagram Post Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagram-reels-rhythm-mixing-in-musical-elements/"><u>2024 Approved Instagram Reels Rhythm Mixing in Musical Elements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/accurate-recordings-of-console-games-on-home-computers/"><u>Accurate Recordings of Console Games on Home Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/ai-powered-attacks-on-banks-and-computers-how-safe-are-we-from-cybercriminals-using-tools-like-chatgpt/"><u>AI-Powered Attacks on Banks and Computers: How Safe Are We From Cybercriminals Using Tools Like ChatGPT?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/clearing-up-a-401-unauthorized-error-expert-strategies-and-solutions/"><u>Clearing Up a '401 Unauthorized' Error: Expert Strategies and Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/essential-fixes-for-windows-11-not-shutting-down-correctly/"><u>Essential Fixes for Windows 11 Not Shutting Down Correctly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/explore-our-selection-of-top-4-no-cost-virtual-planners-online/"><u>Explore Our Selection of Top 4 No-Cost Virtual Planners Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/fixing-malfunctioning-special-function-buttons-on-an-asus-notebook/"><u>Fixing Malfunctioning Special Function Buttons on an ASUS Notebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-track-vivo-x90s-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Track Vivo X90S without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-bridging-communication-gaps-effective-use-of-slack-and-filmora/"><u>In 2024, Bridging Communication Gaps Effective Use of Slack and Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/navigating-potential-twitch-downtime-identifying-global-outages-vs-personal-connectivity-challenges/"><u>Navigating Potential Twitch Downtime: Identifying Global Outages vs Personal Connectivity Challenges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-mastering-your-meta-quest-headsets-built-in-mic/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Mastering Your Meta Quest Headset's Built-In Mic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-foundations-of-lexisaudioscript-your-first-steps-into-audio-editing/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Foundations of LexisAudioScript Your First Steps Into Audio Editing</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

After all, your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-wont-turn-on-4103788" >iPad won’t turn on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if it doesn’t have power. An iPad’s battery generally has a life of a few years, but it will eventually start to hold less power and need to be recharged more often.</p><p> It’s not easy to replace the battery in an iPad because Apple designs its products with solid cases that can only be opened with effort and skill. But that doesn’t mean you need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-ipad-models-and-generations-1994232" >buy a new iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when the battery starts to die.</p><p> Here are four options for replacing an iPad battery that won’t hold a charge:  </p><h2 id="Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-Under-Warranty-AppleCare"><a href="#Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-Under-Warranty-AppleCare" class="headerlink" title="Battery Replacement for iPads Under Warranty (AppleCare)"></a>Battery Replacement for iPads Under Warranty (AppleCare)</h2><p> If your iPad is under its original warranty, or you purchased<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-warranty-plus-applecare-1999284" >AppleCare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s still in effect, Apple will replace the battery (actually, the entire iPad) for free. Know, however, that a warranty doesn’t cover batteries that have suffered from normal wear and tear.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-phone-under-warranty-2000667" >check if your iPad is still under warranty <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by entering your iPhone’s serial number into <a class="link"   href="https://checkcoverage.apple.com/" >Apple’s warranty checker tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .  </p><p> If your warranty is still active,<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair" >go to Apple’s iPad Repair &amp; Service support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select<strong>Get service</strong> . You can also<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601" >set up an appointment at an Apple Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and take your iPad in.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/back-up-your-ipad-1999864" >Back up your iPad data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before handing over your iPad to avoid losing your data. The repaired or replaced iPad should arrive three to five business days after you give yours to Apple.</p><p> Apple may test your iPad to see if the problem was caused by something not covered by the warranty (if so, your replacement likely won’t be free). Also, if the iPad has an engraving on it, the turnaround time can be up to two weeks, since Apple will also engrave the replacement iPad.</p><p> While<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-not-to-buy-iphone-insurance-1999610" >we don’t recommend buying additional insurance for your devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may have insured your iPad (or have a policy that covers all your tech). If so, check your insurance policy to see if battery replacement is covered.</p><h2 id="Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-With-Expired-Warranty"><a href="#Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-With-Expired-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="Battery Replacement for iPads With Expired Warranty"></a>Battery Replacement for iPads With Expired Warranty</h2><p> If your iPad is out of warranty, Apple will repair the battery for a fee. How much it costs depends on the model; see the iPad Repair &amp; Service page above for an estimate. To initiate a repair, start a service request on Apple’s site or go to an Apple Store.</p><p> Even if you have to pay for the battery replacement, it’s a decent price to get an iPad working again. That said, you should consider the cost of repair versus the cost of getting a new iPad. If the iPad with the failed battery is old, it may be better to put that money toward the cost of buying a new iPad.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ipad-battery-life-tips-1999807" >extend your iPad’s battery life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by disabling certain features like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/used-ipad-guide-how-to-1994595" >5 Things to Consider Before Buying a Used iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="iPad-Battery-Replacement-at-Authorized-Repair-Shops"><a href="#iPad-Battery-Replacement-at-Authorized-Repair-Shops" class="headerlink" title="iPad Battery Replacement at Authorized Repair Shops"></a>iPad Battery Replacement at Authorized Repair Shops</h2><p> Some shops repair iPad screens and batteries. These repair shops may even be found in kiosks in many malls and may charge less than Apple. If you plan to use one of these repair shops, look for one that is authorized by Apple to provide repairs. That means they’re trained and experienced. An inexperienced repair person may cause more problems than they solve. Apple may not fix these problems if they were performed by an unauthorized provider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1444782">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1444782">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1444782%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1444782/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="DIY-iPad-Battery-Replacement"><a href="#DIY-iPad-Battery-Replacement" class="headerlink" title="DIY iPad Battery Replacement"></a>DIY iPad Battery Replacement</h2><p> It’s possible to replace an iPad battery yourself with the right tools and skills.

My kids are in middle and high school, with a college student in the mix as well. Our family has found different tech tools helpful at various points in their educational journeys.</em></p><h2 id="Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals"><a href="#Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals" class="headerlink" title="Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals"></a>Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals</h2><p> Does your child need a laptop or a desktop computer? It could be that they need both, plus accessories (known as peripherals) like mice, webcams, and headphones.</p><p> Laptops are great for letting kids work when they’re on a school bus, waiting for a ride, or hanging out anywhere there is a Wi-Fi connection. They don’t always have the same power and capabilities, however, that a desktop PC might. But for completing most middle- and high-school assignments, they should work just fine.</p><p> Some schools or districts provide students with Chromebooks free of charge; others don’t. On the other hand, college students are almost always expected to provide their own devices (like laptops or computers).</p><p> Depending on your child’s situation, you might need to budget this year for a new laptop or desktop computer, or you might be able to get away with adding just a few peripherals like a new mouse, webcam, or speakers.</p><p> Beware of school policies around Chromebook lending. In most cases, parents must sign releases indicating they will be responsible for anything that might happen to the device. That can put you on the hook for a spendy replacement or repair you might not be ready for. Schools do have other options they can give you, including requiring the student to keep the Chromebook at school or providing them with paper assignments instead.</p><p> The real trick is deciding what you need to buy. While it’s tempting to purchase the cheapest items, that can backfire because “inexpensive” sometimes translates into cheap materials that can’t withstand your child’s activities or the occasional tossed backpack. Less expensive devices may also lack the speed or power to do everything your student needs them to.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/editor-s-choice-the-best-tech-gifts-for-back-to-school-7692969" >Editor’s Choice: The Best Tech Gifts for Back To School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5xqW8ViVbQNgb2VUsUblogbwFco=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Studentswithlaptopsondesksandbeanbags_skynesher_GettyImages-1456220436CROPPED-19c3059f597a4aa1b038835c96bacc75.jpg"                      alt="Students using laptops at tables and in bean bag chairs."                ></p><p>Skynesher&#x2F;Getty</p><p> For example, if your child is a STEM kid or a graphic artist, more power and storage are necessary overall. On the other hand, kids who just need to manage basic projects and complete homework on time will probably do fine with a standard Chromebook.  </p><p> As you make your purchases, consider how long the item will last with your child. Some kids are rough on technology, while others are more thoughtful and responsible; age often dictates how nice I’m willing to purchase for a specific child.</p><h3 id="Look-for-Student-Discounts"><a href="#Look-for-Student-Discounts" class="headerlink" title="Look for Student Discounts"></a>Look for Student Discounts</h3><p> Check for discounts before you buy!

If your download speed suddenly seems slow, find out if your favorite game is downloading a few gigabytes of patch files.</li><li><strong>Avoid signal interference that slows your internet speed.</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-place-for-wireless-router-816570" >Reposition your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for better performance and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-channel-number-change-to-avoid-interference-818208" >change your Wi-Fi channel number <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The closer your device is to the router, the better the Wi-Fi connection.<br> To confirm if wireless interference is the reason for the slow internet connection, connect a computer to Wi-Fi and measure its performance. Then, connect the same computer to the wired network and note any changes in performance.<br> If the cable allows for a better connection, the problem could lie in the wireless connection. Instead of moving the router, consider a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh network setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mesh-network-vs-range-extender-4148022" >signal repeater <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> Large, dense objects such as fireplaces block Wi-Fi signals more than walls. A device that is close to a router, but blocked by a barrier, may not successfully connect.</li><li><strong>Make sure your router and other network equipment are working.</strong> To troubleshoot potentially faulty equipment, temporarily rearrange and reconfigure your gear while experimenting with different configurations.<br> Systematically try bypassing the router, swapping cables, and testing with multiple devices to isolate the slow performance of a specific system component. Then, decide if it can be upgraded, repaired, or replaced.</li><li><strong>Beware of worms and other malware</strong> by regularly scanning for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526" >viruses and other malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

These tests reveal whether your local computer’s outbound connection is impaired. If you get decent throughput on a speed test but your computer’s connection still seems slow, the problem may reside in your computer (for example, active download sessions or you’ve maximized memory, disk, or CPU utilization on your device).<br> If your computer runs above 80 percent consistent utilization for system memory, disk input&#x2F;output, or CPU cycling, the computer may struggle to maintain optimal performance. Network slowdowns follow—not because the network is problematic but because the computer is overtaxed.<br> To check relative resource utilization to determine whether another component is affecting network performance in Windows 10, right-click the<strong>Start</strong> button, select<strong>Task Manager</strong> , and choose<strong>Performance</strong> . On a Linux computer, use the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-command-2625828" >top command <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

When they run, they limit the bandwidth available for other apps.<br> Other network activity could affect overall bandwidth. A smart TV streaming movies, a camera constantly relaying HD video, and smart speakers playing music can slow everything on the network.<br> Household appliances and your neighbors’ wireless networks can also interfere with your computers.<br> In addition, when routers,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-modem-817861" >modems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or cables malfunction, they don’t correctly support network traffic at full speeds. Certain technical glitches in network equipment negatively affect performance even though connections can still be made.<br> You could also have an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/brief-history-of-malware-153616" >internet worm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a malicious software program that spreads from device to device through computer networks.

In addition, there are other perks you might not be aware of: Being an EV owner also means you’ll snag more of a VIP experience when you slide into a parking spot. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="You-Often-Get-to-Park-Really-Close"><a href="#You-Often-Get-to-Park-Really-Close" class="headerlink" title="You Often Get to Park Really Close"></a>You Often Get to Park Really Close</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YrhFIpC2j4V97my-OLo5AcoCO2M=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Womanloadinggroceriesnearchargingstation_praetorianphoto_Eplus_Getty-54e38e27568d49ccb562b823fbc215f5.jpg"                      alt="Woman loading groceries into EV at supermarket charging station,"                > </p><p>praetorianphoto&#x2F;E+&#x2F;Getty</p><p> Have you ever noticed that when you pull into certain stores, businesses, or hotels, a couple of free EV charging stations are near the entrance? These parking spots are marked for EV parking only and sometimes have a 1-hour time limit for charging although some do allow overnight access.</p><p> Businesses that include these spots do pay for the privilege of hosting these charging stations but they know it also attracts EV owners to their store over others, so the cost is worth it to them.</p><p> Because the charging equipment requires lots of electricity, they are within close reach of a barrier-free access aisle and the EV. You won’t always need to charge up your vehicle but it’s a convenient option for when your battery is a bit low, and it’s a sweet perk as these spots are super close to buildings.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ev-charging-levels-explained-5201716" >  Level 1 vs. Level 2 vs. Level 3 Charging Explained  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Another parking perk? According to<a class="link"   href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/ev-adoption-and-the-price-of-parking/" > The Kleinman Center for Energy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many cities provide free or discounted EV parking at charging stations in municipal garages. This perk can save you quite a bit, as all-day parking fees can get pricey in covered spots such as city garages.</p><p> The next time you’re out and about in your EV, keep your eyes peeled for a free charging spot and consider it an eco-win for the day. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/charging-your-ev-away-from-home-5202284" >  Charging Your EV Away From Home: Everything You Need to Know  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="You-Can-Get-HOV-Access-Even-if-it’s-Just-You"><a href="#You-Can-Get-HOV-Access-Even-if-it’s-Just-You" class="headerlink" title="You Can Get HOV Access, Even if it’s Just You"></a>You Can Get HOV Access, Even if it’s Just You</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fbJyXYgug9Jw_uFlqerMHwe6uGU=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-1307311749-4f057a5501414bc582f7f2d13cc9b38f.jpg"                      alt="HOV lane sign over a highway"                > </p><p>Michael Vi &#x2F; Getty Images</p><p> Zipping along in the HOV lane is a bit like scoring a FastPass+ at Disney World. It’s empowering, fun, and you can feel a little bit superior over those drivers slogging along in the non-HOV lane next to you. </p><p> HOV access lanes are a huge benefit for EV drivers, even those without passengers. Usually, those lanes are brimming with carpooling commuters and ride sharers, but EVers can drive solo in these lanes in a handful of states, including California, Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, and more. Every state’s HOV incentives are a little different, so check your state websites for specifics.</p><p> Take a look at the Alternative Fuels Data Center’s<a class="link"   href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/HOV" > list of states and provinces that let EVs in the HOV lane <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or offer high-occupancy toll (HOT) incentives for electric vehicles.</p><p> Many states give HOV access to EVs via a special sticker or license plate to indicate that the vehicle is eligible to drive in the high-occupancy lane. These benefits have hugely influenced folks to buy EVs, especially in densely populated areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles. According to a<a class="link"   href="https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How%5FDoes%5Fthe%5FPresence%5Fof%5FHOV%5FLanes%5FAffect%5FPEV%5FAdoption%5Fin%5FCA.pdf" > UCLA study about EV adoption rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , access to the carpool lane is the “single biggest incentive” to buy electric vehicles for Californians living within 10 miles of an HOV lane. </p><p> The ability to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half is another plus. Research has shown that providing HOV lane access for electric vehicles can jumpstart EV adoption in other areas and could make a dent in cutting emissions across the United States. </p><p> Qualifying models for HOV lane programs vary by state, so be sure to check with your home state’s transportation website for the requirements in your area.</p><p> It’s also worth noting that state HOV lane programs are continually evolving as qualifying vehicle registrations have jumped in number. The states that paved the way in utilizing HOV lane exemptions for EVs—such as Arizona, California, and Virginia—discovered the programs were so successful that they reached their maximum planned HEV (hybrid electric vehicles) quota a lot earlier than anticipated.</p><p> Be sure to do your research into HOV access while you are researching EVs. </p><h2 id="EV-Eligibility-IDs-Permits-and-Other-Perks"><a href="#EV-Eligibility-IDs-Permits-and-Other-Perks" class="headerlink" title="EV Eligibility, IDs, Permits, and Other Perks"></a>EV Eligibility, IDs, Permits, and Other Perks</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tEMmx929VUSAEmrCjne4kel5N3Y=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-87340568-f6791150fb074bba83b37d52351b6f22.jpg"                      alt="Electric vehicle license plate"                > </p><p>Image Source &#x2F; Getty Images</p><p> Once you’ve checked to see whether your state offers HOV lane access for your EV, there is a bit more to wrap your head around. </p><p> Some programs may have a cap on participants, so it makes sense to apply early to get your benefits. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Identification"><a href="#Identification" class="headerlink" title="Identification"></a>Identification</h3><p> According to the Alternative Fuels Data Center, the ID method for eligible vehicles varies per state.

Some states, like North Carolina and New Jersey, do not require identification for eligible vehicles, which means qualified out-of-state EVs may also use high-occupancy lanes. In the Garden State, in comparison, qualified drivers need to register their HOT transponders to receive a 10% toll discount.</p><h3 id="Permits"><a href="#Permits" class="headerlink" title="Permits"></a>Permits</h3><p> Another thing to consider are permits.

But it depends on your audience, number of followers, and a post’s relative engagement compared to the averages for your account.</p><p> Try these methods to give your content the best chance to go viral on Instagram.</p><p>01</p><p>of 10</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tailor-Your-Message"><a href="#Tailor-Your-Message" class="headerlink" title="Tailor Your Message"></a>Tailor Your Message</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BzK_OT2FJ1VfLWrQn-dqaTk0FsM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-reply-to-a-specific-message-on-instagram-7bc15dac77674bb58e07e23695cc981b.jpg"                      alt="A woman wearing blue overalls with headphones around her neck holding an iPhone smartphone and checking Instagram messages."                ></p><p>PeopleImages&#x2F;iStock&#x2F;GettyImagesPlus</p><p> This obvious tip isn’t just about your audience’s age and location. You will have to drill down into your content on Instagram before you find the specific posts most of your followers are engaging with. Are they looking for funny memes, informative tutorials, or inspiring stories?</p><p> Take advantage of<a class="link"   href="https://creators.instagram.com/grow/insights" >Instagram Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the default analytical tool available for Creator and Business accounts (but not personal ones). Also, check the demographic that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-see-who-saved-your-instagram-posts-4770639" >saves your posts the most <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the kind of things they like.</p><p> As your Instagram presence improves, consider more powerful paid analytical tools like<a class="link"   href="https://www.hootsuite.com/" >Hootsuite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.iconosquare.com/" >Iconosquare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which cover multiple social accounts.

Some options are behind-the-scenes glimpses at your job or hobby, personal stories, exclusive news, or creative angles on everyday moments. Does the post appeal to our basic human drives and emotions (positive or negative)?</p><p> Support your posts with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-instagram-captions-4171697" >creative captions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a consistent visual aesthetic (as Instagram is a highly visual platform). Experiment with hashtags. Popular hashtags don’t guarantee virality, so combine them with niche ones. Lastly, check your posts and see if they have the “surprise” factor.</p><p> Track engagement in the first few hours. A surge in likes, comments, and shares compared to the usual is a strong indicator your post might be taking off.</p><p>03</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Watch-the-Explore-Page-but-Don’t-Copy"><a href="#Watch-the-Explore-Page-but-Don’t-Copy" class="headerlink" title="Watch the Explore Page (but Don’t Copy)"></a>Watch the Explore Page (but Don’t Copy)</h2><p> Instagram analytics and the<strong>Explore</strong> page give you a good idea of trending content. You can use the viral posts in your niche and take them as inspiration. What can you add (or subtract) to make them your own?</p><p> Maybe a food reel on Instagram has gone viral. Your own reel can show the prep work that goes into the dish, along with quick tips and hacks to make cooking the dish easier and faster.</p><p> Ensure you credit the original Instagrammer who inspired you.</p><p>04</p><p>of 10</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114263/17093" target="_top" id="2114263">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114263" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114263/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Target-a-Niche"><a href="#Target-a-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Target a Niche"></a>Target a Niche</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1lr9CqLqGkH1eN7hGwF-ZkC47qw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/black-food-influencers-you-should-follow-on-instagram--if-you-don-t-already--feaf6413a68645418bfc421929a31fc1"                      alt="Black Food Influencers You Should Follow On Instagram (If You Don&#39;t Already)"                ></p><p> Instead of a scattershot, focusing on your strengths (finding a niche) can deliver better results.

The Instagram algorithm still favors fresh posts. Remember, this tactic will be unique to your needs and audience, so don’t go by any generalized advice.</p><p> Use analytics tools or study your past post performance with Instagram Insights to identify peak times. The built-in feature can give you clues for ideal posting times.</p><p>08</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Go-Viral-With-Instagram’s-Reels-and-Other-Features"><a href="#Go-Viral-With-Instagram’s-Reels-and-Other-Features" class="headerlink" title="Go Viral With Instagram’s Reels and Other Features"></a>Go Viral With Instagram’s Reels and Other Features</h2><p> Start by understanding<a class="link"   href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-ranking-explained/" >how Instagram’s algorithm works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Then, use all the different Instagram storytelling mediums, such as Reels, Stories, and Live sessions. Every little step moves you towards the tipping point for viral posts.</p><p> For instance, Reels are TikTok-style short videos ideal for short attention spans. Add trending audio, effects, and hashtags to make your Reels more discoverable. Publish them at the perfect time with custom Reel covers and captions to hook your audience’s curiosity.</p><p> Stories are a good fit for behind-the-scenes, more casual stuff. The chances of them going viral are lower, as they last only 24 hours. But they are great for experimenting with various content and boosting engagement.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/instagram-live-video-4129154" >Instagram Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent way to make instant connections with your followers. You can use Stories and a countdown ticker together to tell your community when to tune in.</p><p> Broadcast channels (only available on a Creator account) are also a good tool for reaching your followers directly and keeping them invested in your future posts. They are also discoverable by anyone on Instagram.</p><p>09</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Enlist-Influencers-to-Your-Cause"><a href="#Enlist-Influencers-to-Your-Cause" class="headerlink" title="Enlist Influencers to Your Cause"></a>Enlist Influencers to Your Cause</h2><p> Influencers set trends, and the Explore page is the quickest route to find them in your niche.

You can find and collaborate with influencers here while learning what makes their posts go viral.</p><p> Also, look for nano-influencers (with around 10K followers) and micro-influencers (with 15k-75k followers), who often have smaller but more engaged communities behind them.</p><p>10</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Don’t-Spam"><a href="#Don’t-Spam" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Spam"></a>Don’t Spam</h2><p> It’s really tough to go viral on Instagram. One of the best things you can do is to post regularly and on schedule. Instagram’s algorithm likes consistency, and your followers will like a consistent voice at a consistent time. Posting too frequently, however, can make Instagram reduce your visibility and reach.</p><p> Too many posts in a short time can fatigue your audience and lead to lower (and low-quality) engagement. Play the patient long game, as Instagram success isn’t instant or guaranteed. Use Instagram’s scheduling tools to balance the frequency of your posts and keep working on their quality.</p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-premier-video-converters-for-tweeting-videos/"><u>[New] Premier Video Converters for Tweeting Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-no-followers-to-a-million-top-15-tricks-to-become-an-instagram-phenomenon/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From No Followers to a Million Top 15 Tricks to Become an Instagram Phenomenon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/control-your-windows-10-connectivity-tips-for-managing-network-discovery-settings/"><u>Control Your Windows 10 Connectivity: Tips for Managing Network Discovery Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/drivers-reset-nvidia-display-now-functional/"><u>Drivers Reset: Nvidia Display Now Functional</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-resolving-opengl32dll-not-detected-problems/"><u>Expert Tips for Resolving OpenGL32.dll Not Detected Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-lava-blaze-curve-5g-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Fix Lava Blaze Curve 5G Find My Friends No Location Found? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/rumored-apple-ring-info-leaked-insights-into-price-points-release-schedule-and-features-awaiting-confirmation/"><u>Rumored Apple Ring Info Leaked: Insights Into Price Points, Release Schedule & Features Awaiting Confirmation!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/top-6-kid-friendly-websites-offering-complimentary-film-viewings/"><u>Top 6 Kid-Friendly Websites Offering Complimentary Film Viewings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-your-iphones-dimmed-flashlight-12-essential-strategies/"><u>Troubleshooting Your iPhone's Dimmed Flashlight: 12 Essential Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-with-download-for-gigabytes-z370p-d3-system-controller-driver/"><u>Ultimate Guide with Download for Gigabyte's Z370P D3 System Controller Driver</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

All the cables have been meticulously connected. Each piece of equipment has been switched on. Then, you hit “play” on the audio source, yet nothing happens. How frustrating!</p><p> But don’t toss your remote at the wall just yet. Instead, try these troubleshooting tips to get your brand new sound system up and working.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Fix-a-Stereo-Receiver-That’s-Not-Making-Sound"><a href="#How-to-Fix-a-Stereo-Receiver-That’s-Not-Making-Sound" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix a Stereo Receiver That’s Not Making Sound"></a>How to Fix a Stereo Receiver That’s Not Making Sound</h2><p> This should take around 30 minutes and can be done by anyone with basic receiver knowledge.</p><ol><li><strong>Check the power</strong> . Ensure that all plugs are firmly seated in their respective sockets because sometimes a plug can slip out halfway and not draw power. Double-check that wall switches operating any outlets are flipped on.<br> Confirm that all units in the system, including any<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/surge-protectors-4145796" >power strips or surge protectors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , are able to turn on. If something doesn’t power up, test it with another outlet that you know functions properly.<br> It’s a good idea to connect equipment to outlets that don’t have wall switches.</li><li><strong>Check the speaker&#x2F;source selection</strong> . Many receivers have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/benefits-of-adding-speakers-using-b-switch-3134657" >Speaker B switch for adding more speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Make sure that the right ones are enabled, and check that the correct source has been selected.</li><li><strong>Check the speaker wires</strong> .<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/quickly-test-speaker-connections-3135135" >Inspect and test each of the wires <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> leading from the receiver&#x2F;amplifier to the speakers, paying close attention to damaged or loose connections. Inspect the bare ends to ensure that enough insulation is stripped off. Also, confirm that the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/choose-different-speakerwire-connectors-4135435" >speaker wire connectors are correctly installed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and inserted far enough to make steady contact with the speaker terminals.</li><li><strong>Check the speakers</strong> . If possible, connect the speakers to another working audio source to ensure that they still operate correctly. If the speakers still don’t play, they may be damaged or defective. If they do play, reconnect them to the system and continue.<br> You’ll need a 3.5 mm-to-RCA stereo audio cable to connect speakers that have 3.5 mm or RCA connections, such as a laptop or smartphone.</li><li><strong>Check the source components</strong> . First, test whatever source component (device) you’re using—such as a CD player, DVD&#x2F;Blu-ray player, or turntable—with another working TV or set of speakers. If the device still doesn’t play properly, then your problem is most likely with the device.<br> If all source components are good, connect them back into the original receiver and set them to play some input. Toggle through each input source on the stereo receiver one by one. If the receiver works with some input sources but not others, the cables connecting the component to the receiver could be the problem. Replace any suspect cables and try the original component again.</li></ol><h2 id="Causes-of-a-Stereo-Receiver-Not-Making-Sound"><a href="#Causes-of-a-Stereo-Receiver-Not-Making-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Causes of a Stereo Receiver Not Making Sound"></a>Causes of a Stereo Receiver Not Making Sound</h2><p> Silent stereos are usually caused by low power, a wrong source selection, disconnected or faulty speaker wires, broken speakers, or a malfunctioning source component.
