## ESR's Latest Innovation in Fast Charging Technology with CryoBoost for iPhone N-Series | Learn How It Beats Heat and Speed Limitations

[![ESR Qi2 MagSafe Chargers for Apple Devices](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/3edfda6c425601ebd7dba3aacdfa11fecad3dc8a/2024/09/09/c9f187cf-13c3-48fb-aa32-d790e2fb4ddc/esr-magsafe-chargers-lineup.png?auto=webp&width=1280)](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1200223&u=4338022&m=80610&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fturtlebeacheu.sjv.io%2F1r0r59) 

ESR

If you want fast charging options to keep your Apple devices powered up without burning a hole in your wallet, either figuratively or literally, then ESR's new Qi2 MagSafe CryoBoost technology is for you. Unlike other chargers that cool with built-in fans and heat transfer from charger to phone – a process that can cause condensation damage to your device or battery – CryoBoost uses a cooling fan and heat-dissipating hardware to stop your phone from overheating.

ESR chargers power up an iPhone 15 Pro Max in only two hours. That's a half an hour faster than Qi2 chargers manufactured by other brands. And that's as fast as official MagSafe chargers, at only a fraction of the price.

ESR makes charging accessories that work whenever, wherever you need them, whether you're at your desk or on the road. Here, we break down a few of the options.

## **The patented tech behind CryoBoost**

ESR

Heat is an inescapable part of wireless charging, but recent innovations mitigate temperature differences that would otherwise hurt charging efficiency. This year, ESR tweaked its patented duct designs into a fully open layout to keep the air flowing. How does that work? CryoBoost hinges on a semi-arc parabolic duct with a 103-degree tilt. If that still sounds like a lot of math and physics, then let's simplify even more: the duct design enables smooth, unobstructed airflow to the back of your phone. More air means more cool.

Noise is an all-too-common problem with other accessories like laptop cooling pads that are known for their humming fans. Using aero-acoustics and fluid mechanics, ESR has reduced the secondary flow between blades. Noise is kept under a quiet 25 decibels, even at speeds of 5,000 RPM. That's like a whisper from a few feet away.

Use the stand to charge your iPhone in portrait mode to read messages or landscape when streaming videos. Refuel your AirPods case on the base of the charger while your Apple Watch sits snug on the pedestal. The Apple-certified charging stand boasts impressive numbers: An Apple Watch Series 9 charges to 75 percent in 70 minutes—50 minutes faster than chargers that are not certified by Apple.

ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes called the ESR 3-in-1 MagSafe charger his "[new favorite travel accessory.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-3-in-1-magsafe-charger-is-my-new-favorite-travel-accessory-and-it-supports-qi2/)"

ESR's [Qi2 MagSafe Car Charger with CryoBoost (HaloLock)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D7MSX6GG%3Fmaas%3Dmaas%5Fadg%5FE332C8286640FABC130335C5E8F1B46F%5Fafap%5Fabs%26ref%5F%3Daa%5Fmaas%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C452f81a0-1cb4-487a-9fe6-037d53208320%7Cdtp&dtb=1) has 18 strong N52 magnets that provide a 1,600-g grip, so your phone won't slip off when you drive on a bumpy road or take a sudden turn. The charger easily clips to your car's air vent, so drivers can access their iPhones for navigation and Bluetooth phone calls, but can also remove it quickly when exiting the vehicle. The charger can also be secured to the dashboard.

This is a 15W MagSafe car charger that juices up your phone at blistering speed, even when using GPS navigation apps. The two hours and seven minutes to power your phone is nearly two hours faster than most Qi2 car chargers, and 35 minutes faster than car chargers with cooling systems.

## **A MagSafe battery pack to keep you fueled on the go**

ESR

Featuring a multiple-award-winning built-in kickstand design, the [Qi2 MagSlim Kickstand Power Bank 5,000mAh](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D7LXJF2R%3Fmaas%3Dmaas%5Fadg%5F3BE47512344C845AA34AF35B60E7C07D%5Fafap%5Fabs%26ref%5F%3Daa%5Fmaas%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C452f81a0-1cb4-487a-9fe6-037d53208320%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is the slimmest Qi2 charger on the market, perfect for space-saving and on-the-go charging.

This powerhouse 15W MagSafe backup comes in fun colors. It's compact and slim at only 15.5 mm thick, or 38 percent slimmer than comparable packs. The battery has a built-in kickstand and a strong magnetic grip of 1,200-g. It can juice an iPhone 15 Pro to 84 percent in under 2.5 hours. For comparison, a 7.5W power bank can't hit that charge even in three hours.

While the ESR Battery Pack doesn't come with CryoBoost technology, the bank stays under a breezy–at least for technology–99 degrees F thanks to NTC sensors that measure its temperature and a custom AI algorithm that keeps it regulated. This is especially important since you'll most likely be holding your iPhone – or it'll be stashed away in a pocket, purse, or backpack – when the battery is attached.
