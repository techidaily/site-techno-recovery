![convert lit to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-lit-to-pdf .jpg)Lit (shortened from "literature") is a file format which can only be accessed on Microsoft Reader. It is an extension of the Microsoft Compressed HTML Help format that includes drm. Because of its restricted access on other popular e-reader devices, such as iPad, nook, kobo, and Sony, it seems impossible for you to read lit ebook on other devices. However, it's possible now for I'm writing this guide to teach you how to convert lit to pdf with easy steps.

Before you start to convert lit to pdf, I want to give you an important tip. That is you have to make sure your lit ebook is drm free. If it's drm protected, you should remove drm first as usual.
