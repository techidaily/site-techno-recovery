## Decoding the Appeal of Netflix for Avid Viewers and Streaming Enthusiasts

Close 

 Netflix is a popular[ streaming service](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-streaming-how-it-works-1999513) that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original content. It's available on[ smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) , through streaming devices, and even on your smartphone and tablet using the official app for iOS or Android. Here's what you need to know about Netflix, including pricing and information, and popular content.

**Download the app** :  

[ Netflix for iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/app/netflix/id363590051) 

[ Netflix for Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient) 

 As of December 2, 2019, Netflix no longer works on 2010-2011 or earlier smart TVs from Samsung, 2012-2014 Vizio smart TVs running Internet Apps/Apps Plus, and several older Roku media streamers. Other older smart TVs and media streaming devices may also be affected. Contact your device's tech support for more details.

## A Brief Netflix History 

 Netflix started in 1997 as a company that pioneered the concept of[ renting DVDs by mail](https://www.lifewire.com/netflix-dvd-rental-4778663) . It devised the innovative concept of charging a flat monthly fee instead of charging by each DVD ordered. As a result, the corner video rental store phenomenon started to fade away. By 2005, Netflix had a loyal 4.2 million DVD-by-mail rental subscriber base.

 In 2007, Netflix made the bold announcement that it would add the ability for subscribers to stream TV shows and movies directly to their PCs in addition to its DVD-by-mail rental program.

 After that, it didn't take long for Netflix streaming to become available on the Xbox, Apple devices, a growing number of TVs, smartphones, and tablets. Today, it's readily available in many households.

 You can access Netflix content through various internet-connected devices, including smart TVs, Blu-ray Disc players, game consoles, smartphones, and tablets by using Netflix's app on these devices. Any internet-connected device with a Netflix app can bring you its full array of content.

##  How Much Does Netflix Cost? 

 All this entertainment isn't free. As of 2024, the Netflix fee structure is as follows:

* **Standard with Ads** : $6.99 a month with four to five minutes of ads per hour. Two devices may stream at a time in Full HD. All but a few movies and shows are available.
* **Standard** : $15.49 per month. Watch in Full HD resolution. View content on a laptop, TV, phone, or tablet. Access unlimited movies and shows. Download content on two mobile devices and watch content on up to two screens at the same time.
* **Premium** : $22.99 per month. Enjoy Full HD and Ultra HD resolution, including Netflix spatial audio. Allows viewing on up to four screens at the same time, and you can download content on up to six mobile devices.

## What to Watch on Netflix 

 Once you have access to the Netflix service, you see an on-screen menu that allows you to navigate through hundreds of TV shows, movies, and original content. Browse by category or use the search tool. When you find something you want to watch, select the program's icon to start your entertainment.

 Netflix offers an array of programming options. New titles are added frequently, and older ones are removed periodically. Here's a sampling of what you can currently expect to see:

### AMC TV Shows 

 Enjoy shows that originally appeared on AMC, including:

_Breaking Bad_ ,_Better Call Saul_ ,_The Walking Dead_

### CBS TV Shows 

 Enjoy shows that originally appeared on CBS, including:

 Because of its focus on its[ Paramount+ platform](https://www.lifewire.com/cbs-all-access-4155838) (formerly called CBS All Access), CBS has fewer Netflix offerings than it used to.

 If it's a current, multi-season show, you have access only to past seasons, not the currently running season. TV shows typically run one season behind on Netflix.

 Netflix adds programs and movies each month, and the service also deletes content frequently. Netflix doesn't post that information on its service menu, but you can find it from third-party sources.[ Netflix posts a list of upcoming additions to its original content](https://media.netflix.com/#/new?page=1) .

##  Netflix Hidden Genre Categories 

 Another interesting aspect is the extensive[ hidden genre category list system on Netflix](https://www.lifewire.com/netflix-secret-codes-find-and-watch-hidden-movies-4583157) . As you use it, its TV and movie selection menus begin to conform to what it thinks are your genre preferences. That content offering system tends to box in viewers with limited choices. As a result, many users resort to using the search tool to find what they want.

 However, you can access dozens of additional categories by typing special URL codes into the browser address bar. These codes take you to additional niche categories, ranging from "Movies for ages 8 to 10" to "New Zealand Movies" and more.

##  The Netflix Download Option 

 Netflix has a download option alongside its streaming service at no extra cost. After updating the app on a compatible device (such as a media streamer, iOS, or Android phone),[ download selected Netflix content](https://www.lifewire.com/download-netflix-tv-shows-movies-4134207) for later viewing at home or on the go.

 You can begin watching content that's only partially downloaded, which is handy if you're in an area with poor Wi-Fi. Once you find a stronger internet connection, you can choose to finish your download and resume watching.

 Also, if you take advantage of the Smart Downloads feature, you can download selected content for offline viewing on iOS or Android devices that automatically delete after viewing. This saves space and time. When you follow a series, after the episode you watched is deleted, the next episode downloads automatically.

## Netflix in 4K 

 In addition to streaming traditional TV and movie content,[ Netflix offers an increasing number of programs for streaming in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830) (mainly in-house produced programming). The 4K listings are visible only if Netflix detects that you're viewing on a 4K-compatible video display.

 For those who don't have 4K access, many Netflix TV shows and movies are offered in 720p and 1080p resolution, as well as Dolby Digital Surround Sound.

 Netflix automatically scans your internet connection. If your broadband speed can handle the 1080p signal, the resolution is automatically downscaled.

## Netflix-Recommended TVs 

 While Netflix is available on many devices, and they all have access to the platform's streaming library, not all of them have access to 3D or 4K content. Many don't always incorporate the most currently available on-screen interface and other operational or navigation features. As a result, Netflix maintains a list of recommended TVs. Some of the criteria to make the list include:

* **Latest Netflix Version** : Your TV automatically (or by prompt) updates to the most recent version of the interface.
* **TV Instant On** : When you turn on the TV, the Netflix app is ready to use.
* **TV Resume** : Your TV remembers where you were when you last had it on, whether it was watching Netflix or another TV channel or service, and takes you back when you turn on the TV again.
* **Fast App Launch** : When you click the Netflix app, it takes you there quickly.
* **Fast App Resume** : If you're watching Netflix but need to leave and use another TV function or watch a non-Netflix program or service when you return, it remembers where you left off.
* **Netflix Button** : The TV has a dedicated Netflix direct-access button on the remote control.
* **Easy Netflix Icon Access** : If you use the TV's on-screen menu to access Netflix, the icon must be prominently displayed as one of the content access choices.

 For a periodically updated list of devices that provide Netflix access (but may not necessarily include all of the above criteria that TVs are evaluated under), check out the official[ Netflix Supported Devices list](https://help.netflix.com/node/14361) .
