## Expert Picks: Leading VPN Routers for Secure Home Networks, 2024 Edition - CNET Guides

When you're looking for a new [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) setup, you'll have a choice to make: either install the VPN software individually on your laptops, mobile devices, and TVs or install a VPN directly on your router for blanket coverage.

VPNs provide encrypted tunnels to protect online communication, making it more difficult to track or steal your information. They also give you the chance to change your IP address so you appear to come from a different location. Setting up a VPN environment via your router can take the legwork out of protecting the multitude of devices we use, and it can be far easier to do than you think -- as long as you have a compatible router to start with and are comfortable with undergoing the [VPN installation process](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-on-your-router/). 

Some VPN providers, too, provide router hardware with a VPN that is already installed and ready to go.

### ExpressVPN Aircove

#### Best VPN router overall

The ExpressVPN Aircove is our top pick based on its speed, ease of setup, and security. It offers dual-band connectivity for homes or offices, providing coverage of up to 1,600 sq. ft.

When you pick a VPN-ready router, you still need to consider stability and speed. The $189 Aircove manages speeds of up to 1,200Mbps (600Mbps/2.4GHz) when the VPN is not in use, although, as we should expect, speeds will drop when you are connected to VPN servers. 

An interesting feature is an option to diversify the servers used by devices connected to the router. For example, you might want a gaming PC disconnected from the VPN and an office laptop to run through a US or UK VPN server. Furthermore, parents and guardians can take advantage of parental control settings. 

Customers report excellent speed and performance, although it can be tricky to set up.

However, you will also need an [ExpressVPN subscription](https://www.expressvpn.com/). A free trial is included with the router purchase. We consider ExpressVPN to be one of the top VPNs on the market with excellent speed and stability.

Many customers consider the Archer GX90 to be a solid, fast router, although its design doesn't suit everyone.

## VPN router vs VPN app: How do you decide?

There are advantages and disadvantages to using a VPN-enabled router or a standalone VPN app, the most important of which are compared below.

| A VPN router can be complicated to set up, and most routers do not come with a built-in VPN. You may also risk your router's warranty. | VPN apps are typically easy to install and use.                                                           |

## How to set up your VPN Router: Configuration and Encryption made simple

Installing a VPN on your router allows all of your devices to access the same VPN network and connection. This creates blanket protection and IP masking, but it can be challenging to set up.

Remember that your router will act as a VPN client rather than a server and share the VPN with devices connected to it. Here are some general steps to take, although they may change depending on your router and existing setup:

* Check your router's compatibility. Not every router will run a VPN natively -- although many modern routers do have the capacity.
* Sign up for a VPN service. Unless your router comes with a built-in VPN, you will likely need a subscription.
* Access your VPN's firmware. You will need to do so through your router's IP address.
* Under settings, you should find a VPN tab, and you will need to enable VPN services and choose between a static or dynamic IP address.
* The VPN client can now be installed, although you may need to tweak your network settings.

## Which is the right VPN router for you?

| **Choose** **this** **VPN** **router...** | **If** **you** **want...**                                                                                                                                                                         |

| ExpressVPN Aircove                        | A user-friendly VPN router with solid coverage and speed. While the router is exclusive to ExpressVPN usage, it is one of our favorites due to its price, reliability, and easy setup.             |

## Factors to consider when choosing a VPN router

When you are considering a new VPN router, there are some key points you should mull over before making a purchase decision:

* **DIY?**: If you want a VPN for your home network, you should consider whether or not you would be happy to install a VPN directly on your router. If not, consider a router model with an in-built VPN.
* **Affordability**: VPN routers are available for a variety of budgets. However, if you can, you might consider a future-proof VPN router that can support next-generation Wi-Fi.
* **VPN**: You also need to take into account the VPN service you want to use. If you have a preferred VPN, ensure that the router you want supports it.
* **Other purposes**: The VPN might be the most important aspect, but you should also consider whether or not other features are important to you -- such as tri-band functionality, gaming optimization, or additional security features.

## How did we choose these VPN routers?

While we were deciding on the best VPN routers of 2024, we considered a number of crucial factors, including:

* **Speed**: There's no point investing in a new router capable of handling VPN environments unless it serves its core purpose: to provide solid and stable connections to the internet.
* **VPN support**: We have included a range of models with in-built VPNs, VPN support for standalone VPN services, and mobile products for VPN protection on the go.
* **Budgets**: We wanted to provide a variety of options suitable for different budgets, but our priorities were security, speed, and reliability.
* **Customer reviews**: We have also examined customer reviews in-depth, including both positive and negative experiences.
* **Vendor reputation**: We have considered the reputation of router manufacturers, including their popularity, variety, and product accessibility.

For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive [VPN testing methodology page](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/).

## The bottom line: Is a VPN router worth it?

If you want to install a VPN directly onto a router, the process can be more of a hassle than just signing up for an app. However, it can save you time in the long run as any device -- including PCs and smartphones -- that connects to your router will use the VPN and will be automatically protected. In particular, this can be useful if you have internet-connected devices, including TVs and IoT products, that cannot support a VPN on their own hardware. 

You might want to consider setting up a VPN on your router if you have numerous devices needing protection and you are working from home. However, if you are a remote worker, some organizations may require you to use their own VPN to access corporate resources.

A caveat: some online platforms, such as streaming services, will detect when you are using a VPN and may block you. If this is the case, you may have to temporarily disable your VPN service to resume watching.

### Can any router be a VPN router?

Many routers are now smart, intelligent devices capable of far more than providing an internet connection. Today, you can install VPN software on a range of routers, and many tout VPN support as a feature. 

However, a word of caution: installing third-party software on your router might void its warranty -- just as jailbreaking mobile devices or changing the firmware of a gaming console can invalidate a warranty. 

### Why would anyone use a VPN?

A VPN can be a great tool for protecting your privacy. VPNs should be used when you are taking advantage of public Wi-Fi hotspots, at the least, but using them while you're online as default is the better option to protect yourself and your information. VPNs are also beneficial in circumventing geolocation blocks and censorship.

However, you should keep in mind that some countries either ban VPN usage entirely or heavily discourage it. If using a VPN is illegal, you may be fined or prosecuted. According to NordVPN's [country guide](https://nordvpn.com/blog/are-vpns-legal/), countries that ban VPNs include Belarus and Iraq, among others, whereas governments in China and Russia only permit specific VPNs to operate. 

### Does a work VPN expose my home network to my employer?

It's possible (albeit unlikely), but it depends on several factors. VPNs handle traffic in different ways, but, overall, it is highly unlikely that company IT administrators will be able to access your home network via your VPN connection. However, if you are on a work-issued laptop with software that allows such connections, admins may be able to tap into resources on the device. 

Additionally, while VPN tunnels encrypt your traffic and mask your online activities, if you are using a VPN designed and owned by your employer, they can monitor you.

### Does a VPN slow down your internet connection?

Typically, yes, although a high-quality VPN -- hopefully -- will not make a noticeable difference. There are caveats; for example, you should expect a slowdown when connecting to servers across a long distance, such as from the UK to Australia. If you experience severe speed loss when you are connecting to servers closer to you, however, such as from New York to Washington, this may indicate a problem with either the VPN or your ISP connection.

## Are there alternative VPN routers worth considering?

You can put VPN software on many devices, from PCs to mobile devices and routers. While we have showcased what we consider to be the best VPN-supporting routers in 2023, we can't highlight every worthy option -- so you can check out alternative products below, including subscriptions:
