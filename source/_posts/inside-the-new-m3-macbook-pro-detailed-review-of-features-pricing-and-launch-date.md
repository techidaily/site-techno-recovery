## M3 MacBook Pro Features and Specs

 There are three levels of MacBook Pro systems in two sizes: 14- and 16-inch. There are three processors available (although the 16" only offers the two higher-end systems): M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max.

| Chip   | CPU cores | GPU cores |
| ------ | --------- | --------- |
| M3     | 8         | 10        |
| M3 Pro | 11 to 16  | 14 to 18  |
| M3 Max | 14 to 16  | 30 to 40  |

 The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at 8GB RAM (up to 24 GB), while the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max can go all the way up to 128GB of RAM.

 Storage options range from a 512GB SSD to a massive 8TB one, though the higher options are only available on M3 Max models.

 Apple also showed off a new color for MacBooks: Space Black. This option isn't nearly as colorful or exciting as the options for iMacs, but it is new. It's also only available for the M3 Pro and M3 Max models.
