## Trouble with PhysXLoader.dll? Hereâ€™s How You Can Solve the Absence Issue
 Physxloader.dll errors are caused by the removal or corruption of the physxloader [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . This file is associated with the PhysX physics engine from NVIDIA.

 Information in this article applies to all Microsoft [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including [Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Physxloader.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download the physxloader.dll file from a "DLL download" website. There are several reasons why[downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) .

1. [Download the PhysX System Software from NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/physx/physx-9-21-0713-driver/) and install it on your PC to replace the missing or corrupted physxloader.dll file. This is the original source of this file, so it's completely safe. Just be sure to[restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) after the installation.  
 Another option, instead of installing it, is to extract its files. After downloading the program through that link, use a program like[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to get all the files out. You'll find physxloader.dll in this folder, after which you can copy it to wherever the error says it's missing from:  
 `\PhysX\files\Common\`  
![The physxloader DLL file extracted in a folder in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z6AjK2Fdi3W-_8lKiR-_gaDiDBE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/physxloader-dll-file-5b31a73b29a44658b75893b9eb0ff13c.png)  
 If the error occurs while playing a particular game, another option is to check the game's installation folder for a version of the PhysX System Software.  
 You may need to [start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Restore the file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted physxloader.dll, you might be able to restore it from the Recycle Bin, but only if you haven't already emptied it. If so, try using a[data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
![Recycle bin on the Windows 10 desktop](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s5Z2YB-fL-dSbgEE-h-buDUr6ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_how-to-fix-physxloader-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623904-deb166390f754113b284bb7952b86ae9.jpg)  
 Only recover a deleted physxloader.dll file if you're positive that you deleted it yourself and that it was working fine prior to doing so.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . The error you're seeing could be related to a virus or even a hostile program masquerading as the real file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect the error was caused by recent changes made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could be helpful.
5. [Reinstall the program that uses the physxloader.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the software should replace the missing file.  
 Most physxloader.dll issues are caused by problems with the[Steam](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380) client. If reinstalling Steam doesn't fix the problem,[the Steam Community forum has instructions for repairing game files](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/412446292767270802/) .
6. [Update hardware drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Update drivers for hardware devices that might be related to physxloader.dll. For example, if you see the "physxloader.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the [drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your [video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
![Update driver option on the Windows Device Manager menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/itjj--Xx7lObudHbWtfx6WlaxmI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/006_how-to-fix-physxloader-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623904-cba6a78a5c2f41c0920e412aba4026c5.jpg)
7. [Roll back your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If the physxloader.dll error began after updating a particular hardware device, roll back the device drivers to an older version.
8. Use a [free Windows registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to remove invalid physxloader.dll [registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the error.
9. [Perform a clean install of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) as a last resort to start with a fresh copy of the operating system.  
![Windows installation screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9AMmG4zWVZiG3nQaz2WtJBvOtZI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/010_how-to-fix-physxloader-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623904-7f4082e6d7514b1a8f97753b5ded8792.jpg)
