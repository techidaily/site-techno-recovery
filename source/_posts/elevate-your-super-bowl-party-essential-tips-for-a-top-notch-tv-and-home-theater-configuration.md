## Elevate Your Super Bowl Party: Essential Tips for a Top-Notch TV and Home Theater Configuration
 The Super Bowl is a great excuse to upgrade your home entertainment system. Whether you're a cord-cutter, cable or satellite subscriber, or over-the-air (OTA) viewer, here are some ways to make the most of this year's Super Bowl broadcast.

 For 2024, the 58th Big Game will be held on Sunday, February 11, and broadcast on CBS and Nickelodeon. The game broadcast will begin at 3:30 p.m. PST/6:30 p.m. EST from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, NV, with several hours of pre-game TV programming.

## How to Watch the Super Bowl in HD

 If you have cable or satellite TV, you need a subscription package that includes HD content. Check with your provider for HD content pricing and options.

 If you're watching the game through an OTA signal, you will need an[antenna](https://www.lifewire.com/benefits-of-antenna-use-3276150) . To view the OTA broadcast in HD, your TV needs to have an[ATSC tuner](https://www.lifewire.com/atsc-3-0-the-next-step-in-tv-broadcasting-4061759) (all HDTVs made after 2009 qualify).

[Mohu Blade TV Antenna Review](https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201)

 If you'd prefer to live-stream the game, you have[many options](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-watch-the-super-bowl-online-4156817) for that, too. You will need a fast internet connection to stream any content in HD.

 Whatever your viewing method, to receive HD content, you need an HDTV. If you don't own an HDTV and want to buy one in time for the Super Bowl,[LED/LCD](https://www.lifewire.com/truth-about-so-called-led-televisions-1847935) flat-panel sets are the most affordable options. Check out our suggestions for 1080p LED/LCD TVs and 4K Ultra HD TVs, including LED/LCD and OLED.

[How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107)

[Although discontinued in 2014](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-plasma-tvs-1847857) , plasma TVs provide better motion response than LED/LCD TVs, making them ideal for sports.

## How to Watch the Super Bowl in 4K Ultra HD

 For those not viewing in 4K, a[4K Ultra HD TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-you-need-to-see-4k-1847330) will still enhance your viewing experience. These sets can upscale signals, adding more perceived detail from HD broadcasts, and they can future-proof your setup for years to come.

 Another display option is an[OLED TV](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-tv-basics-1846926) . LG and Sony are the only brands that make these rather pricy TVs, but they support 4K resolution and a crystal clear, high-contrast image.

 When shopping for your Super Bowl TV,[be wary of Curved Screens](https://www.lifewire.com/curved-screen-tvs-1847848) . Although these sets look fancy, keep in mind that if you have a large group, the people sitting off to the sides may not have a complete view of all the action.

## How to Watch the Super Bowl on a Video Projector

 Video projectors can deliver a huge screen size, which is excellent for a large group, but[the setup requirements](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-video-projector-4118669) are different than that of a TV. You will need a[video projector](https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-a-video-projector-1847845) and a[large screen or a blank white wall](https://www.lifewire.com/video-projection-screens-1847844) . If you're planning to run the projector in a room during daylight with drapes, blinds, or curtains that you can draw, you need a projector that can emit a lot of light. A growing number of projectors are bright enough for such conditions.

 For the best result, consider a projector with a rated light output of 2,000[lumens](https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-nits-lumens-brightness-4125499) or more or refer to Projector People's[lumens guide](https://www.projectorpeople.com/resources/lumen-guide.asp) . Use projectors in a dimly lit or light controllable room.

 Most projectors don't have built-in TV tuners, so you will also need to connect a cable or satellite box to the projector using an HDMI connection.

 If you have a small room, you might consider a[short throw projector](https://www.lifewire.com/short-throw-video-projector-4154187) .

 Most video projectors do not have built-in speakers, and the ones that do are not much better than a tabletop radio. For the best result, you need to connect either an analog or digital optical output connection from your set-top box to a home theater receiver,[soundbar](https://www.lifewire.com/sound-bar-option-1846567) , or sound base.

## How to Stream the Super Bowl

 As mentioned previously,[you also have the option of streaming the Big Game live](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-watch-the-super-bowl-online-4156817) . You will need to check streaming options for recorded broadcasts if you are not home on the big game day.

## How to Listen to the Super Bowl on the Radio

 If you don't have access to the game through cable or streaming, it will be broadcast[Westwood One-affiliated radio stations](https://www.westwoodone.com/2017/08/04/westwood-one-kicks-off-its-31st-consecutive-season-as-the-exclusive-network-radio-partner-of-the-nfl/) and[other sources](https://www.lifewire.com/listening-to-super-bowl-on-radio-2843103) .

 The Super Bowl will also be broadcast on TV and Radio through the Armed Forces Network (AFN) in[Europe](https://www.afneurope.net/) and the[Pacific](https://www.afnpacific.net/) for those serving worldwide.

## How to Get the Super Bowl in Surround Sound

 There are several ways to get surround sound, depending on your setup. Here's how to get surround sound on HDMI, non-HDMI, and OTA devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### HDMI

 If you have a soundbar or audio receiver with an HDMI input, and if your cable or satellite box has an HDMI output, the easiest solution is to connect everything with an HDMI cable. Connect the HDMI output from your set-top box or streaming device to your audio receiver, then connect your home theater receiver's output to your HDTV.

 A more direct audio path for HDMI systems is an[Audio Return Channel](https://www.lifewire.com/audio-return-channel-1846845) (ARC). With HDMI ARC, you can hear TV audio through your audio system instead of the TV's speakers without connecting analog or digital optical audio cables between the TV and the audio system. To take advantage of this option, both your TV and home theater receiver or soundbar needs to have ARC connections.

### No HDMI

 If you do not have an HDMI input, you can still get the game in surround sound. HD cable or satellite subscribers should have a digital optical audio output connection. Connect directly from the box to the digital optical audio input connection on your home theater receiver. You can now access the surround sound signal from the cable or satellite feed. If you don't have a home theater system to complement your HDTV, consider getting a soundbar or[home-theater-in-a-box](https://www.lifewire.com/home-theater-box-system-1845702) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Over-the-Air

 If you're planning to watch the Super Bowl through an over-the-air (OTA) antenna connected to an HDTV with an ATSC tuner, check to see if your HDTV has a[digital optical](https://www.lifewire.com/digital-optical-connection-1846881) audio output connection. If so, attach the digital audio output of the HDTV to the home theater system's digital audio input, and you will experience the surround sound feed for the Super Bowl.

 If your HDTV does not have a digital optical audio output but has a set of analog stereo outputs, then connect those outputs from your HDTV to your home theater or audio receiver. Check to see if your home theater system has a[Dolby Prologic II, IIx, or DTS Neo:6](https://www.lifewire.com/surround-sound-formats-guide-1846778) setting option. If so, you will still be able to get a surround sound signal from the stereo input signal. However, it is not as effective as a surround sound signal through a digital optical audio connection.
