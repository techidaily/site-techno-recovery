It is universally acknowledged that Audiobooks downloaded from Audible.com or Audible Windows App are in the Amazon proprietary format AAX or AA and locked by DRM which prevents you from sharing your purchased audiobooks with your friends. 

However, since Audible app is updated to 2.37.0 in June 2019, the Audible files downloaded via Audible app for Android have all changed to a new format **[AAXC](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**. although now there is no tool that can directly deal with Audible AAXC files, we can still remove Audible DRM and convert Audible books to MP3 by following this simple guide.

Thank you for using our software. To split audible into chapters, please click on "Option" button next to your audible book title, and then select "split by chapter", then go back to the main interface of Epubor Audible Converter. Then click on "Convert to mp3", this time you will get your audible books converted to mp3 in chapters.
