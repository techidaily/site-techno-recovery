[ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-the-worlds-most-popular-ai-chatbot-explained/) isn't the only AI tool you can use to create your own specialized chatbot assistants. With the [latest flavor of Google Gemini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-gemini-just-got-two-popular-chatgpt-plus-features-and-one-is-free-to-use/#link={), you can create [assistants, or Gems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-gems-are-a-gentle-introduction-to-ai-prompt-engineering/#link={), which are customized versions of the Gemini chatbot designed to tackle specific tasks and save you time in your workflow.

Don't know how to code? No worries, you won't need to. You can start with either a premade Gem or create a new Gem from scratch using your own text instructions. For now, Gems are available only to paid Gemini subscribers. Here's how they work.

## How to create custom AI assistants with Gemini Gems

## 1\. Sign up for a paid account

To take advantage of Gems, you'll need one of the paid Gemini tiers -- [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google/advanced/), [Business](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/), or [Enterprise](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/). For one person, the Advanced option makes the most sense and is the least expensive. Otherwise, large organizations can check out the Business or Enterprise options.

To access Gemini Advanced, you need a [Google One AI Premium plan](https://one.google.com/about/ai-premium/) for $19.99 a month. If you don't already have a paid subscription and want to try it, sign into [the Google Gemini website](https://gemini.google.com/app) with your existing Google account. Click the "Try Gemini Advanced" button at the top, as seen in the image below. Follow the steps to kick off your subscription following a free one-month trial.
