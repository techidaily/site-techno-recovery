Promotions & sales are coming in thick and fast after January's lull, and VPN providers are not missing out on the action. 

On February 14, AtlasVPN launched a new promotion, "Privacy is a big deal," which, as you might suspect, includes discounts on VPN subscription plans. Of particular note is an 83% discount applied to [two-year VPN subscriptions](https://atlasvpn.sjv.io/c/159047/928109/12618?&sharedId=zdnet&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), which brings the cost down to only $1.82 per month. If that's not enough to sweeten the pot, the company is also throwing in three months of access for free.

[AtlasVPN (save $247) $1.82 at Atlasvpn](https://atlasvpn.sjv.io/c/159047/928109/12618?&sharedId=zdnet&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

The deal requires that you [pay for the plan](https://atlasvpn.sjv.io/c/159047/928109/12618?&sharedId=zdnet&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) in one go, which equates to $49.19\. Alternatively, you can purchase one year of access for the equivalent of $3.29/month, or $39.42, a saving of $92 (70%). Access for one month is $10.99\. 

You can use the coupon code **BIGDEAL**.

In our review of the [top affordable VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-vpn/) on the market, AtlasVPN scored highly. 

The company implements a no-logs policy and features are on offer including a safety shield, multi-hopping, a kill switch -- which prevents you from inadvertently switching to insecure Wi-Fi points if your connection drops -- and compatibility with major operating systems. 

Cheaper VPN options tend to skim on security, but in this case, AtlasVPN completes independent [security audits](https://atlasvpn.com/blog/atlas-vpn-completes-its-first-independent-security-audit-by-versprite). These audits are designed to find existing vulnerabilities alongside areas of improvement. The only caveat we've found is that server and country options are somewhat limited.
