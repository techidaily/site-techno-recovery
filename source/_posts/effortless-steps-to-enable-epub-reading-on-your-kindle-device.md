### Step by Step on How to Read EPUB on Kindle

**Step 2**. Run Epubor Ultimate to Convert EPUB to Kindle Mobi or AZW3 format.

Just drag and drop the EPUB books to the main interface of Epubor Ultimate, choose the output format as Kindle mobi, azw3 format.

#### **Why should we convert ePub to mobi/azw3?**

EPUB is an opened and free ebook format, which is so popular that almost all eReaders support ePub format except Kindle devices. EPUB has many advantages, such as automatically changing font size, turning page and so on. That's why many people read ebooks in ePub format. But Kindle devices own a large market share in eReaders, so reading ePub on kindle fire or other kindle devices will be a wonderful experience.
