##  How to Fix Alexa Not Responding to Voice Commands 

 Sometimes you issue a voice command, but Alexa and your Echo don't respond or respond with something like, "Sorry, I don't know that one," or "Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now. Please try a little later." If Alexa isn't responding correctly, there are some easy fixes to try.

1. [ Make sure your Echo has internet and power access](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-echo-and-alexa-to-wi-fi-4158308) . This is a simple, basic troubleshooting step, but it's worth it to make sure. An unplugged Echo or internet outage might be why Alexa's ignoring you.
2. [ Make sure the Echo's microphone is turned on](https://www.lifewire.com/stop-alexa-from-listening-5121012) . The microphone is turned off if you have a solid red light ring or bar instead of a solid blue one. Press the microphone button on top of the device to turn it on again. See if Alexa can respond to your commands.  
 You know, maybe Alexa can't hear you. Move the Echo closer to where you're speaking.
3. Make sure your smartphone and Echo are on the same Wi-Fi network. View this information from the Wi-Fi settings area of your smartphone and from**Device Settings** in the Alexa app.  
 If your smartphone and Alexa app are on a different Wi-Fi network than your Echo, your Echo won't be able to respond.
4. Make sure the Alexa-enabled device is in Wi-Fi range (30 feet). Alexa might seem unresponsive because your Echo is too far from the router. Move it closer to the router to see if this solves the problem.
5. Restart the Alexa-enabled device by unplugging and plugging it back in or removing and reseating the batteries. See if restarting your Echo solves the problem of Alexa not responding.  
 A simple restart often solves a host of mysterious tech problems.
6. [ Check the Wi-Fi connection](https://www.lifewire.com/alexa-wont-connect-to-wifi-4175141) . If your Wi-Fi is down, reset it and see if that gets Alexa responding again.
7. Check what Alexa heard in the Alexa app. Tap**More** \>**Settings** \>**Alexa Privacy** \>**Review Voice History** . Reviewing your Alexa history from the Alexa may reveal Alexa thought you said, "Play mushroom" instead of "Play music."  
[ How to Delete Alexa History ](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-amazon-alexa-recordings-4157589)
8. [ Change the wake word](https://www.lifewire.com/change-alexas-name-5120885) . If Alexa and your Echo aren't responding, try changing the wake word and see if that gets your smart speaker and digital assistant back up and running.
9. [ Reset the Alexa-enabled device to factory defaults](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-alexa-on-echo-devices-4795683) . If all else fails, try resetting the Alexa-enabled device back to factory defaults to fix the issue.  
 If you choose this option, you must register the device to your Amazon account and enter device settings into the Alexa app again.

##  How to Fix Alexa Playing Music on the Wrong Device 

 Multi-room audio lets you control music playback on Echo speakers. If you're asking Alexa to play music on an Echo device in one room, but another Alexa-enabled device starts playing music somewhere else, there are a few solutions to try.

1. [ Make sure you've set up a smart home device group.](https://www.lifewire.com/create-smart-home-groups-with-alexa-4587458) When you add all your Alexa-enabled smart home devices to a group, Alexa can respond more intelligently to your requests. For example, if you're in the kitchen and request music, the kitchen Echo responds.  
 If a group is already set up, try deleting it and setting up a new one.
2. [ Make sure the right Echo is set as your preferred speaker](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-alexa-preferred-speaker-and-how-to-set-one-up-4783787) . If you want to set one of your Echoes as your default speaker, designate this in Alexa's settings. This way, whenever you request music, only the designated Echo responds.
3. Name your Echo devices accurately. Log in to your**Manage Your Account Devices** page from a web browser > select your Echo from the**Devices** tab > and click**Edit** \>**Save** to make naming changes.  
 Keeping track of your Echo speakers is easier if they're named logically. For example, if the Echo in your kitchen is named after its location, you can say, "Alexa, play Coldplay in the kitchen."

##  How to Fix Alexa Not Connecting to Wi-Fi 

 If your device has a screen, check the light on the device. If it's orange, the Wi-Fi connection isn't working correctly. Here are some ways to troubleshoot your Alexa Wi-Fi connection:

1. [ Check the internet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) . If Alexa can't connect to Wi-Fi, it may be because your internet is down. See if your internet is up and running. If it isn't, take steps to restore your internet connection.
2. Restart your modem and router. Often rebooting your modem and router fixes Alexa's Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Unplug both devices and wait 30 seconds. Plug the modem back in and then wait at least one minute to plug in the router. Wait at least two minutes before using either device.
3. Restart your Echo device. Remove the batteries and return them, or unplug and plug your Echo back in to restart it. A simple restart may fix Alexa and the Echo's Wi-Fi connectivity issues.
4. [ Make sure your Wi-Fi password is correct](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-your-wifi-networks-password-2487651) . If you're connecting to Alexa with the wrong Wi-Fi password, this could cause a problem. Test the Wi-Fi password on another device, and if necessary, change it and try connecting Alexa again.
5. Make sure your Alexa-enabled device is in Wi-Fi range. Your Alexa-enabled device might not be in the recommended 30-feet Wi-Fi range. Move it closer to the router and away from walls, metal objects, or other possible sources of interference.
6. [ Reduce Wi-Fi congestion](https://www.lifewire.com/choose-the-best-wifi-channel-for-your-router-2378202) . Turn off any Wi-Fi-connected devices you aren't using and see if this solves your Wi-Fi connectivity problems.
7. Reset the Echo to factory settings from**Device Settings** in the Alexa app, or by using button presses or a paper clip. Resetting the Echo to its original settings might gets things connecting again.  
 Resetting your Amazon Echo device to its original settings is a last resort. If you reset the device, you'll need to register it to your Amazon account and enter the device information again to use it.
