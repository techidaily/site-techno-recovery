## Discovering the Secrets of Android Gaming Success and Lessons Learned.

### Key Takeaways

* Even if your phone is old, you'll be surprised at how many of the latest high-end games you can play.
* You may find that many of your favorite console or PC games support Android cross-progression, and that you already have access to high-quality Android games through subscriptions like Netflix.
* If you're still on the fence about Android gaming, try using wraparound controllers or gaming headphones to bring the immersion closer to what you might be used to on console.

 For a long time, I dismissed Android as not a "real" gaming platform. But I've discovered that Android has a lot to offer gamers like myself who are always seeking the next great experience. I recently got serious about Android gaming, so here are my tips on what I wish I knew before.

##  Your Current Device Is Probably Great for Gaming

 When it first occurred to me that I might enjoy mobile games, I wasn't sure that my current phone was up to the task of high-end gaming. However, if you own an Android phone or tablet released in the last few years and you’re only using it for basic tasks like social media and streaming music, then you may be overlooking its true capabilities. Many modern Android devices can happily run top-tier games, either natively or via cloud streaming.

 An Android device's capacity for gaming primarily comes down to the hardware, like the processor and RAM. Another important factor is [which version of Android OS you have](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-sound-issues-in-windows-solutions-for-audio-pop-ups/). But you don't necessarily need the latest flagship phone for it to competently handle high-end [games with console-like graphics](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/obs-microphone-not-working-discover-the-6-most-effective-solutions-of-2024/), such as _[Wuthering Waves](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kurogame.wutheringwaves.global)_ or [_Ex Astris_](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gryphline.exastris.gp).

 Though it was released in 2024, _Wuthering Waves_ only requires Android 7.0 or newer. This means that even certain phones from as far back as 2016, such as the Google Pixel XL, are capable of installing it. Keep in mind that this is just a minimum requirement and that using a newer, more powerful device can make the game run smoother or look better.

 To check a game's compatibility, visit its Play Store page, select "About This Game", and scroll to the "Compatibility For Your Active Devices" section.

##  Start With the Games You Already Play

 My journey deeper into Android gaming began with a desire to take my console experiences with me on the go. Many popular games, including [_Stardew Valley_](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley) and [_Genshin Impact_](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact), have cross-platform progression features that enable you to sync your account or transfer save data across Android, PC, and other platforms.

 For example, I can play [_Honkai: Star Rail_](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea) on PC from my study, continue on PS5 while on the couch, before later diving in on the Android version when outside. Enabling cross-platform progression in the game is a simple matter of logging in with my HoYoverse account. No matter which device I use, I can pick up right where I left off. Many other games with cross-platform progression features work much the same way.

 The benefit of this approach is that I can knock out daily quests or do some mindless gear grinding when I want to kill some time on my phone. I can even make story progress or complete limited-time events when I'm on a long trip away from my usual setup. If I want to enjoy the game's exciting, cinematic story beats on the big screen, though, I can boot up the PS5 version when I get home.

##  Check Your Existing Subscriptions For Free Games

 You may already have access to a large bank of Android games that you can start playing right away—and I'm not just talking about all the free-to-play games that are prevalent on the Play Store.

 Several [streaming services and news sites have games](https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-on-realme-10t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) that you can access on mobile devices if you have the right subscription. For example, a Netflix subscription offers a selection of major titles including _[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas](https://help.netflix.com/node/133166)_ and _[Dead Cells](https://help.netflix.com/node/132401)_.

 Additionally, there are many great [cloud gaming services](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-secure-your-fb-story-views-with-these-5-techniques-for-2024/) for Android that make it possible to play cutting-edge games that are beyond what your device could otherwise handle. These use the processing power of a cloud computer, rather than that of the device in your hand.

 For example, subscribing to [NVIDIA GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/geforce-now/) allows you to stream some games you own on PC directly to your phone or tablet from anywhere (assuming you meet the system and internet requirements).

##  Accessories Make Android Gaming More Immersive

 If you’re like me, you dismissed Android gaming for years because of the belief it could never replicate the at-home experience. With such amazing Android games coming out in recent years, though, I realized that the quality of the titles is not the problem. Rather, I could never feel fully immersed and in control when playing on a phone or tablet.

 However, wraparound controllers like the [Backbone One](https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhat-i-wish-i-knew-about-android-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) are a total game-changer. It gives your Android phone a Nintendo Switch-like form factor that is comfortable and easy to hold, even for longer gaming sessions. It's a traditional gaming experience with minimal compromise.

 The right gaming headphones can make all the difference too, not only when you're out and about, but also when you want to immerse yourself at home. Wireless earbuds like the [Razer Hammerhead HyperSpeed](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Hammerhead-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Playstation/dp/B0C3G2PMC8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhat-i-wish-i-knew-about-android-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) or [Turtle Beach Scout Air](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Dual-Microphone-Charging-Resistance-PC-Bluetooth-Enabled/dp/B09FV2LMFQ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhat-i-wish-i-knew-about-android-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) provide great sound quality while remaining discrete and convenient.

 Audiophiles might still prefer wired earbuds for Android gaming, in which case the [1MORE Triple Driver](https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Earphones-Headphones-Resolution-Smartphones/dp/B01A7G35S0/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003902&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhat-i-wish-i-knew-about-android-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) buds provide everything you could ask for without making the step toward a full on-ear or over-ear headset.

 If your device doesn't have a traditional headphone jack, you may need a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter to use certain wired headphones.

##  It's Not All Gimmicky, Cash-Grabbing Games

 The most important thing I recently learned about Android gaming is that it is just pure fun. If I want to [kill time while traveling](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-in-lost-mode-by-drfone-ios/), play a game while relaxing in bed, or just have a great experience with the device that’s already in my pocket, I can do that without settling for a gimmicky app game. Mobile gaming is in a very different place now than it was in the days of _Temple Run_ and _Flappy Bird_.

 For me, Android gaming is all about enjoying experiences I can't get on any other platform, as well as the novelty of being able to pick up-and-play anytime and anywhere.

 My mobile gaming rotation frequently includes unique augmented reality games like _[Monster Hunter Now](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.monsterhunter),_ cross-progression games like _Honkai: Star Rail_ that I can resume at home, and loot-fest action RPGs like _[Diablo Immortal](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003902/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.diablo.immortal)_ that can scratch an itch in short bursts. There's a certain degree of fun that specifically comes from being able to play on an Android device.

 There are many unique games you will only discover if you delve deeper into mobile gaming. Open yourself up to it like I did, and you might just find that it's worth your while to get serious about Android gaming too.
