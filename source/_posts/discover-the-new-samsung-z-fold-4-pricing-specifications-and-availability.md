## Samsung Z Fold 4 Features

 The Z Fold 3 introduced S Pen support to Samsung's foldable phone line, so it's a no-brainer that we'd see its continuation with the Z Fold 4\. However, Samsung has not included a built-in slot to hold it, though you can get one with a Standing Cover.

 In fact, the phone itself is thinner than the Z Fold 3 (which is good, since foldables are already thicker than traditional phones), so it makes sense that cutting size leaves little room for the S Pen holder. Of course, this also means it won't be shipped with the phone, either, so you'll have to buy one separately if you really want it.

 Photo Remaster and Object Eraser let you apply post-production edits right there on the phone. You can also save RAW files directly to your Gallery with Pro mode. And Capture View shows a preview of the photo you just captured so you can easily see if you need to retake it.

 The large screen makes it great for multitasking. You can split the screen to use up to three apps at once, and drag and drop across apps. Moving between apps is easy with the improved Taskbar, and you can view more of your favorite apps with Multi View.

## Samsung Z Fold 4 Specs and Hardware

 The Fold 4 is built with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ and an aluminum frame, which Samsung says makes it the toughest Samsung Galaxy foldable yet.

 It has the same rear camera setup as the Galaxy Z Fold 3, but the good news is the 50MP wide-angle main camera. This is vastly different from the 12MP camera in the Z Fold 3\. There's also a 4MP under-display camera, and a 10MP cover camera.

 The upgraded Nightography means you can get closer to really distant objects in the sky with 30x Space Zoom, brought on by the telephoto camera's 3x optic zoom and Super Resolution Zoom.

 There's also good news when it comes to the phone's overall design. The fold crease is something some people have a problem with when it comes to foldable screens—and for good reason. Frequent leaker[Ice Universe](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1529063896740286464) says that while the crease is still visible, it "looks slightly better than Fold3" and "The screen looks smoother."

 The same 256 GB and 512 GB options are available as they were with the Fold 3\. But now there's a 1 TB model, too.

 The battery size is the same as the Fold 3\. Though, the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor likely translates to better energy efficiency, and thus improved battery life.
