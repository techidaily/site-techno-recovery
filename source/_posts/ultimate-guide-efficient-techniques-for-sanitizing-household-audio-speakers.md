 Deals will include Amazon's proprietary tech like the Echo line of automation hubs and Kindle E-readers, and you can expect to see sales of laptops to wearables.

 For those who already have an Alexa-enabled device in their homes, you can remain up to date by asking Alexa to "keep me posted on Prime Day."

 You need an[Amazon Prime membership](https://www.lifewire.com/is-amazon-prime-worth-it-8536157) to get the deals.

## When is Prime Day 2024?

 This year's Prime Day event will occur on Tuesday, July 16, and Wednesday, July 17, but sales start early and end late. Sales typically begin at midnight PDT (3 a.m. EDT) on day one and end at 11:59 p.m. PDT on day two.

## What are the Best Prime Day Deals?

 You'll frequently see deep discounts on many of Amazon's first-party products like Kindles and the Echo line of automation hubs. We also usually see exciting sales on high-ticket items like laptops, wearables, and holiday-related gifts.

## What to Expect on Prime Day

 Tech and electronics always make up many of the best Amazon Prime Day deals, primarily because the company has a significant footprint in the smart home and digital assistant markets.

 Beyond all the sales on Amazon's product lineup, tons of other excellent tech stuff is also likely to be available on the cheap—previous years featured killer deals on some of the best tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches.

 Apple products tend to see rare discounts on Prime Day, so if you've been waiting to pick up Cupertino's latest, it may be the perfect time to open your wallet.

 It's also an excellent time to keep an eye on the competition. Best Buy and Walmart traditionally run sales to counterprogram against Prime Day, so it's worth stopping by their sites (or dropping by a brick-and-mortar outlet if you're feeling bold) to see what's on offer.

## Are There Deals at Other Retailers?

 Outlets like Walmart have launched sales events to counter Amazon's massive deals bonanza. Walmart events offer vast discounts, particularly when paired with its Walmart Plus program, which offers free delivery and access to member-specific sales.

 Best Buy often has a Black Friday in July event on Prime Day. Target has also run a similar promotion, alongside a handful of smaller retailers, to capture some of that Prime Day zeitgeist (and some of that Big Buying Energy).

## What to Watch Out For on Prime Day

 While many of the best Amazon Prime Day deals are what they appear to be (great discounts on flagship products), some of these sales are too good to be true. Beware of sellers trying to offload inventory, including products not selling because of poor construction or deceptive claims.

 Before buying anything, look at reviews (both on Amazon itself and editorial sites like Lifewire).

 It's also worth keeping abreast of tech[news](https://www.lifewire.com/news-4795879) around new releases, as Prime Day is also an excuse for retailers and manufacturers to ditch stock of previous models of an item before the latest model launches.

 That's not necessarily a bad thing and can result in some spectacular price cuts on the last iteration of a product. However, if you prize having the latest and greatest, educating yourself on when the next generation will arrive can prevent buyer's remorse.
