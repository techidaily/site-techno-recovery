 Registration Code  
 Epubor Ultimate for Mac

 but every time I try to use the program the license has expired, and now I have retrieved it three times and I'm not able to retrieve any more.  
 Why does my license expire so often?

[No longer supporting this?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/4/2016 5:53:38 AM 

I bought a lifetime license. I have had several reformats of my system and need a new unlock code. And this probably won't be the last time  
 I am getting ZERO response from tech support. Chats aren't answered, Tickets don't have numbers, emails are never answered.  
 I payed ahead in good faith and would like that good faith to be respected  
 Thanks

[Not receive license email](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/18/2016 2:49:54 AM 

I have purchased the Epubor software, but currently not receive any information about the license code. I also have check the spam email, not find it. 

[Can I get a registration code # for my converter software?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/22/2019 6:50:26 AM 

Can I get a registration code # for my converter software so it will work everytime I open it, even offline? Currently, I have to connect to the internet and input my email address for the program to convert the entire file. Otherwise, all it does is convert 3 minutes, as a trial version.

[Kindle az3 files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2016 6:40:15 AM 

I have been successfully decrypting Kindle files before. I recently had one az3 container file that would not decrypt and later another az3 file that did convert but was just blank white pages.

 Is there any way I can get you these files to see what might be done, if anything, to get these to decode? Others are probably seeing this too :)

[What is the work around for Kindle's latest updated version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 10:25:45 AM 

Amazon requires latest updated version 1.39.2.65383 to be able to download Kindle books to my PC. Epubar gives an error and has prompt to auto-downgrade to version 1.32 because of their inability to crack the code in later versions. I tried this and this work around does not work as Kindle will no longer allow downloads of books in the 1.32 version and requires the update to the 1.39.2.65383 version to be able to do this. As such, what fix/ work around do you have to remedy this issue? 

[Registration Fails with License Email](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2020 4:53:15 AM 

Epubor Audible Convertor v1.0.10.230  
 Windows 10

 When attempting to register the program with the License email, I get the following error: "Registration failed, please try to enter "email;License code" to register.

 However when trying to get the license code from the website, I am sent an email to download the program. I never get the license code.

[PCMAC\_126\_Delivery\_Error\_Upgrade\_PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/15/2023 2:49:16 AM 

Keep getting this error code for certain books. They will download using the latest Kindle for Desktop, but then they can't be decoded. Suspect there is nothing I can fo for these and they are beyond extraction?

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[How do I get paragraph break in convert to text?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/1/2020 8:55:02 AM 

I just purchased an annual license.

 The full version is NOT treating text the same as the full version.

 In trial version, Converting KFX book to Text maintained the paragraph breaks. The Full aversion does not -- so the book is one huge single line.

 How do I get paragraph break in convert to text? 

 FYI, as a work around, I tried converting to PDF as a work around. However, PDF adds LINE breaks (specific to the printed page) as well as Paragraph marks. But it uses the SAME control code for each, so I can't just search and replace line marks and leave paragraph marks.

 I would appreciate your help and guidance to solve this .

 Thanks.

[What is Epubor's fix to work with Kindle's 1.39 version?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/27/2023 1:40:36 AM 

What is Epubor's fix to work with Kindle's 1.39 version? Kindle now requires update to 1.39 version to be able to download their books. Epudor currently requires auto-down grade to 1.32 to be able to crack the DRM code. The problem is that this no longer is a viable solution with Kindle's latest updated version to even be able to download. As such, what is Epubor's work around for this?
