 What We Like

* Offers a clear and functional user interface.
* Good selection of pre-loaded actions.

 What We Don't Like

* Setup is a little confusing for beginners.

 MacroDroid uses macros to automate a wide range of daily tasks and operations. With more than 100 pre-coded actions, MacroDroid helps you maximize your device's potential while minimizing your input efforts.

 Reducing battery usage, managing data connectivity, and creating custom sound profiles are just a few of the many tasks MacroDroid can handle. For more advanced users, scripts, plugins, and user-defined variables are available for additional customization. The app offers a free version with a five-macro limit as well as an unlimited Pro version.

![Screenshot of the E-Robot app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3T5Qriv8FRvSVGwk_2qEwsKKfIk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-auto-clicker-apps-on-android-non-rooted-phones-4427959-7-5c018a8d46e0fb0001ca7001.jpg) 

 What We Like

* An extensive selection of actions and events.
* Offers parameterized editing options.

 What We Don't Like

 E-Robot comes with more than 170 different event types and over 150 action types that all can be edited by parameters. The app can run events that are location-oriented, application-based, time-triggered, and more.

 E-Robot supports Android 4.0 and up, can execute JavaScript, and comes with third-party support for tools such as Ipack icons and plugins. The free version has no feature limitations but does display ads. Purchase a Pro key or donate to the developer to have the ads removed.

 What We Like

* The app clicks and taps quickly and accurately.

 What We Don't Like

* Features are limited.

 QuickTouch is another mobile app that provides fast, accurate auto-tapping. It has a flexible floating panel that acts as the app's start/stop controller. It's great for games that call for aggressive and repetitive tapping. Adjust the click delay, duration, and timeout period as necessary.

 QuickTouch supports Android 7.0 and up, is free to download, and offers a Pro, ad-free version for a low cost.

 What We Like

* Very easy to use.
* The big list of building blocks makes for endless automation possibilities.

 What We Don't Like

* Occasionally stops on some devices.

 Automate uses flowcharts to set automation paths and tasks. Editing your flowcharts is done by adding or removing building blocks, which are visually represented in chart form.

 The app comes with a vast list of building blocks to customize, including alarms, account sync, notifications, Bluetooth, contacts, calendar, camera, Gmail, map, ringtone, and more. There's an active in-app community that shares custom flows and ideas on how to utilize the application.

 Automate supports Android 4.0 and up and is free to download. The Premium version has no restrictions on the number of running blocks.

## [ AnkuLua](https://www.apkbe.com/app/com.appautomatic.ankulua.trial) 

![Screenshots of AnkuLua game bot for Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DKDfPj1yvBfL33dS6bCiag9fO1c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-auto-clicker-apps-on-android-non-rooted-phones-4427959-4-5c0188c6c9e77c00013e318d.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Recording option is easy to use and functions well with most apps tested.

 What We Don't Like

* Free version has a one-script limitation.
* Isn't available on the Play Store.

 AnkuLua works by running scripts that automate the actions you'd take using an app or game. You don't have to write any code or know any programming languages; simply record your activities and then set any additional conditions.

 The app has a community forum where members share scripts and ideas and can get support from the developer. AnkuLua is free ([ learn how to install APK files](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185) ) and supports Android 4.0 and up. A Pro version with more features is available, with prices varying based on how long of a license you purchase.
