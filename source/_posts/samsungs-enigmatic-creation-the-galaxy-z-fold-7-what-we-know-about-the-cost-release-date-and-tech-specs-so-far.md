 One idea floating around is Apple combining an iPhone and an iPad to make a double-wide phone, or maybe the iPhone Flip will fold like the iconic Motorola Razr. These are just rumors for now, and some experts think Apple might release a foldable iPad before a flip phone. Whatever the case, the talk about a foldable Apple gadget is picking up.

## When Will the Foldable iPhone Be Released?

 Jeff Pu, an analyst at Haitong International Securities,[says Apple's first flip phone could come out](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/05/09/apple-folding-iphone-ipad-macbook-release-date/?sh=3862dfed1e98) in 2026\. This is backed up by a[2024 report from The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone) and the Taiwanese newspaper_United Daily News_ which,[according to Patently Apple](https://www.patentlyapple.com/2024/02/a-new-supply-chain-report-claims-that-apples-foldable-iphone-project-is-still-in-the-works-with-vision-pro-team-members-now.html) , reports that part of the[Vision Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-vr-headset-news-and-rumors-6744818) team is working on the foldable iPhone project with the intention of a 2026-2027 launch.

 One idea behind a flexible Apple device is[an iPad that folds](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tablets/news/ipad-foldable-5g-his-market-analyst-jeff-lin-rumour-2065244) . However, rumors surrounding that device might be about an iPhone/iPad hybrid. Of course, nobody knows Apple's plans, and one analyst firm[predicts Apple will launch a foldable iPad first](https://www.patentlyapple.com/2022/10/european-analyst-firm-ccs-insight-predicts-that-apple-could-launch-a-foldable-ipad-in-the-next-few-years.html) .

[Here's what we know about the foldable iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/foldable-macbook-news-price-release-date-specs-rumors-5220052)

 Despite no official details from Apple, they've clearly been interested in a folding device of some kind for several years. Patents filed in 2011, 2014,[June 2016](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10020462) ,[August 2016](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170294495A1/ko) ,[2018](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180217639A1/en?oq=20180217639) , and[2020](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11175956) prove this, and there are probably others we've missed. Of course, this also shows that they haven't brought a foldable device to the market despite apparent interest.

 There are various designs in those documents, and some of them are wildly different from the others (including a way to fold the device multiple ways). The plans could mean that they're referring to something different, like an e-reader or tablet, but they hint at what we could expect with this iPhone.

![Foldable device illustration from patent US8929085B2](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wUd3t6RsFQmJnem6udFt2aVqAOw=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/US08929085-foldable-device-dcde96bb968a4de2b7048ee2ea3d4e33.png)

Patent US8929085B2.

 Another[patent filed in 2019](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190324503A1/en?oq=20190324503) is for a device with a wrap-around display:

> In the described embodiment, the flexible display assembly is configured to present visual content at any portion of the transparent housing.

 Could it be worked into a foldable phone? We are eagerly waiting to see how/if they use these inventions.

### Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

We don’t expect a foldable iPhone until at least 2026.

## Foldable iPhone Price Rumors

 It won’t be cheap. Phones are increasingly approaching or even exceeding $1,000\. Just look at the[iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-15-5202683) which starts at just over a grand.

 What happens when another screen is attached? If the Galaxy Fold is any indication, the price could jump to $2,000\. Apple doesn’t have to follow suit, especially if it wants to dominate sales for dual-screen lovers. Then again, Apple isn't a cheap brand.

 They could shoot for a clean iPhone+iPad mini price by simply adding them together for a $1,400 phone. But considering how new this will be for Apple, they might hike the price a bit and put it closer to that $2k price tag. Unless, of course, they compromise with less-expensive hardware or fewer advancements other than simply two (or three) screens.

 However, if they opt for a clamshell design where the single screen splits in two, we could be looking at a much more affordable phone (but still more pricey than your typical iPhone). If the rumors are true that Apple will have two foldables, clamshell and vertical, expect various prices depending not only on storage and screen size but also on the fold type.

## Pre-Order Information

 It's way too early to suggest a pre-order date, but we'll keep this updated as the launch nears.  

## Foldable iPhone Features

 Over the years, as phones have gotten larger, we’ve enjoyed more screen real estate for things like reading, watching movies, playing games, and multitasking. A foldable phone is perfect for these activities.

 That said, Apple is an innovator. Maybe they can make a version that works better than all the rest. Perhaps it won’t suffer from a visible crease down the middle where the screens fold over each other. Or,[as this patent shows](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10943529) , a foldable Apple phone might use self-heating pixels to help avoid damage when folding. If it has a third screen when folded, maybe the refresh rate could be high enough that it'd be indistinguishable from the primary screens.

 iOS, the software that runs the iPhone, could and should be revamped to support multiple displays. Don't expect it to function_too_ differently than your typical, one-screen iPhone. Too much change would pull dedicated customers away.[iPhone apps](https://www.lifewire.com/the-25-best-free-iphone-apps-4153912) will also need to support multiple screens for them to look great on a dual-screen iPhone. Otherwise, there's no point in the larger phone.

 Given a larger phone could resemble a tablet, it makes sense that it would support the[Apple Pencil](https://www.lifewire.com/review-apple-pencil-3887601) . The latest version currently works only on a small selection of iPads, but expect a new version for the foldable iPhone (unless it's more of a flip phone than a tablet).

 When it comes down to it, a foldable phone is beneficial purely for its bigger screen. Since this would be Apple’s first attempt at this kind of phone, it’d probably be the only significant change to the iPhone that year. Meaning: no stunning new camera, massive storage capacity boost, etc. (though maybe a big battery boost).

## Foldable iPhone Specs and Hardware

 So how will the iPhone Flip work? It’s anyone’s guess, but there are a few options: one large, foldable screen like the Galaxy Fold; two separate screens that fold over a purposefully visible hinge like the[Surface Duo](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-5113055) ; or_three_ screens—two regular ones and a third for when the device is in its folded position.

 Based on leaks, patents, and suggestions, it's looking more like we'll see a clamshell design, at least for the company's first foldable. This means the iPhone Flip would look like a typical phone from a distance, but would fold vertically and could include a small screen on the outside—similar to the[Galaxy Z Flip](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-z-flip-4-news-and-rumors-5525574) .

 Apple is reportedly testing multiple prototypes that contain foldable displays, and they want the phone to be half as thin as a typical iPhone so it's not too bulky when closed. They may release two versions of the flip phone; a dual-screen one and a Z Flip lookalike. Some analysts think the first will be of the clamshell variety.

 Here's an[example of what a clamshell iPhone Flip could look like](https://www.behance.net/gallery/152079273/iPhone-iFold) . The images and videos there, created by artist Michal Dufka, are stunning.

 If it uses two full-size screens instead to resemble a tablet when unfolded, whether it will open backward on itself like the Duo is another question. If it does, we can only hope that it’ll support running an app on both screens simultaneously. Maybe you could play the same video on both screens to watch a video with someone sitting across from you or run two separate apps for something like local gameplay.

 Here's ConceptsiPhone's rendering of a dual-screen "iPhone Fold":

 Analyst[Ming-Chi Kuo thinks we could see a screen as large as 8 inches](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/) . Omdia predicts the iPhone to be OLED and stand at 7.3–7.6” (the larger size would make it the same as the[Galaxy Z Fold 2](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5076492) ). It would indeed be a phone-tablet hybrid; a foldable[phablet](https://www.lifewire.com/phablets-what-they-are-4154579) \-style device.

 Kuo has also revealed that Apple is testing color e-ink display tech that might be used as a second screen for a foldable device:

 Space Gray and Silver are standard colors for Apple’s devices. We’ll probably see those same options for the iPhone Flip and possibly others that other iPhones support, like Graphite, Green, Product Red, Gold, and/or Sierra Blue.

 All brand-new phones, including the latest iPads and iPhones, support[5G](https://www.lifewire.com/5g-wireless-4155905) for faster data transfers on mobile connections. Expect the same for the foldable iPhone.

 Bolstering the battery, processing power, and RAM will be a must to sustain multiple displays that could all independently multitask. Storage space might not change from the current iPhone lineup.
