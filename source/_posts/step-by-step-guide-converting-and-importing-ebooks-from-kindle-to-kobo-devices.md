Most of the ebook lovers have kindle books at hand. Amazon indeed offers us very nice reading resources. But not all Kindle fans choose Kindle device to read, and in fact there are a large number of people love Kobo devices while they love Kindle eBooks. Then, if you want to read kindle books on your favorite Kobo devices, you need to transfer kindle books to Kobo. 

However, we know that Amazon Kindle has its own kindle DRM and kindle formats like kfx, mobi, azw3 and etc. Kobo devices cannot recognize these kindle formats. Hereby we have to figure out a way to remove kindle DRM first and then convert kindle books to the ebook format that Kobo supports. After this, we will be able to transfer kindle books to Kobo to read. 

And this article can be seen as the answer to the question **"How to read Kindle books on Kobo**". You will discover the detailed information in the following part. 

In theory, we need three steps to transfer Kindle books to Kobo: 

* Remove DRM from Kindle books.
* Convert Kindle format to EPUB.
* Transfer converted EPUB books to Kobo.

In this article, we will introduce 2 easy solutions to do the job.

* [Solution 1\. Convert DRM-Protected Kindle books to EPUB with Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Solution 2\. Transfer Kindle books to Kobo with Kindle Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

###  1\. Convert Kindle Books to EPUB then Transfer to Kobo

1 Get Kindle Books Ready on Your Computer

If you read Kindle books with E-Ink Kindle eReader, make sure they have been downloaded into the Kindle.

If you are reading Kindle books with Kindle reading apps, then you need to download the Kindle books to computer via Kindle for PC/Mac. Detailed instruction is here.

1\. Download Kindle for PC/Mac on your computer.

Now you can use the latest version of _[kindle for PC (Version 2.0)](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForPC-installer-2.0.exe)_ and _[Kindle for Mac (Version 1.40)](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg)_ to download kindle books and remove drm with Epubor Ultimate.

2\. Run the Kindle for PC/Mac and sign in with your Amazon account. Then all your Kindle books will be sync to the library automatically.Click the kindle book cover to download kindle books to your computer.  

![download Kindle books to computer](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-kindle-books-new-kindle-app.png)

The downloaded kindle books are usually saved in _"C:\\Users\\User name\\Documents\\My Kindle Content"_.

 If you don't want to find them by this way, you can directly click on the "Tools">"Options">"Content" to see the content folder information. You can also chage the folder to store your Kindle book as you like.

![find the downloaded kindle books](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/local-kindle-files.png)

2 Remove Kindle DRM and Convert Kindle Books to EPUB With Epubor Ultimate

The second thing you need to do is to convert Kindle books to Kobo. Kobo devices can not read Kindle books directly because all Kindle books are protected with Kindle DRM, so let's remove Kindle DRM and convert Kindle books to EPUB format that Kobo devices support.

1\. Download and run [Epubor Ultimate.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)

It's a powerful tool that can both remove ebook DRM and convert ebook formats. We need it to remove DRM from the Kindle books and then convert Kindle formats to epub.

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

2\. Drag and drop the Kindle books from the left to right blank zone.

 As long as your Kindle books are downloaded successfully to your computer, they will all appear under the "Kindle“ tab at the left column. Just drag and drop the books from the left to the right blank zone. The DRM will be removed in a second with "Decrypted" showing.

![convert kindle formats to epub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-kindle-formats-to-epub.png)

3\. Choose epub as the output format and click on the button "Convert to EPUB" to start converting.

f

When the conversion is finished, you can click on the folder icon or "Succeeded" at the end of each title to find the converted epub books.

**Tips:** You can also set PDF as the target output format. You know Some eReaders can recognize PDF files more friendly such as Sony DPT-CP1\. If you want to know more you can read this article [how to convert Kindle to PDF](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

3 Transfer DRM-free EPUB Files to Kobo

Now you get the decrypted and converted kindle books, or we can say the newly-got epub books. They can be read freely on Kobo, Nook, Sony eReaders or any ebook Reader app. They are DRM-free epub books now. 

All you need now is just to connect your Kobo eReader to you computer with USB cable, coppy the newly-got DRM-free epub books to it. Then you will be able to enjoy them on your Kobo device.

### Solution 2\. Transfer Kindle books to Kobo with Kindle Transfer

I guess you may be thinking that "Transfer Kindle books to Kobo with USB is the easiest way. I do not need any another extra program." But actually, the tool [Kindle Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) is not as simple as you might think. It's a useful software which can help us transfer Kindle books to Kobo with ease, even though your Kindle books are DRM protected. It will automatically decrypt Kindle DRM and convert your Kindle books to Kobo supported formats. It's rather amazing, right? I guess you don't want to miss it!

Simply connect your Kindle, Kobo to computer, select target Kobo device, and click "Transfer" button. All the files will be transferred soon.

As the image shows, we can not only copy Kindle books from computer to our Kobo device, but also transfer Kindle books from Kindle e-Ink reader to Kobo eReader.

##### Q: After transferring Kindle to Kobo, book cover doesn't display on my new Kobo device.

A: Though I don't know why but the solution I can share with you is, rename your book file extension from .epub to **.kepub.epub**, then you will see the cover of the transferred book.

Voila! Now you can read all your Kindle books on your Kobo devices. We have to admit that Epubor Ultimate and Kindle Transfer are both powerful and efficient tools with rather clean and user-friendly interface. Let's enjoy Kindle books on your Kobo now!

You can read epubs on PC too. For example you can get an addon for Chrome that turns into an epub reader.

Was a good program but I think a update to Kobo stopped it. The program no longer sees the Kobo attached to it, no matter what I or Epubor support tried nothing worked The computer can see the Kobo, Calibre can see the Kobo, Adobe Digital Editions can see the Kobo. Infact everything else can see the Kobo attached but this program which is a shame as up to the that point it worked really well and did indead make the process much easier. Now I use their ultimate program to convert formats and then use Calibre to transfer. There has not been any update to this software, so I think it has been left behind the Kobo updates which have unfortunately rendered it useless. Epubor did to their credit refund me. So no hard feeling to the company. I hope one day they do update this as I would heartily recommend if it worked

Yes, we won't delete any of your original Kindle files. After drm removed and formats converted, you will get new files (but with the same layout and contents).

I dont usually post comments but this had to be said, "Download upobor for free". Its not free. Its basically clickbait and once you open it they want $30 from you. Mind you, $30 isnt a lot of money but to trick you into thinking youre getting something for free and then youre not is disrespectful and deceitful in my opinion.

I have a few Kindle books the rest are Kobo and Google books.

 I purchased the new Kobo Clara 2e, it's good but I can't get my 141 Google books onto my Kobo.

 Adobe digital editions doesn't seem to work on my Chromebook and I have about 15 days left to return the Clara if I can't bring my Google books accross.

  
 Would this solution work if I used it to resolve my issue.

 Thank you in advance.

Thank you for your comments. If the ADOEB doesn't work on your computer, then there is no way to transfer your google play books to your Kobo device.   
 In such case, you may need to find a computer with windows or mac system to help you finish this task.   
 The truth is no Adobe DIgital Editions only works on Window and Mac system.
