## Mastering the Art of Solving the Common Website Dilemma: The 404 Error Explained
 A 404 error is an[HTTP status code](https://www.lifewire.com/http-status-codes-2625907) that means the page you were trying to reach on a website couldn't be found on their[server](https://www.lifewire.com/servers-in-computer-networking-817380) . Here's what you can do.

## How to Fix the 404 Not Found Error

1:49

1. Retry the web page by pressing**F5** , clicking/tapping the refresh/reload button, or repeatedly trying the URL from the address bar.  
 The 404 Not Found error might appear for several reasons even though no real issue exists, so sometimes a simple refresh will often load the page you were looking for.
2. [Check for errors in the URL](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-troubleshoot-an-error-in-a-url-2624454) . Often times this error appears because the URL was typed wrong or the link selected points to the wrong URL.
3. Move up one directory level at a time in the URL until you find something.  
 For example, if**<www.web.com/a/b/c.htm>** gave you the 404 Not Found error, move up to**<www.web.com/a/b/>** . If you get nothing here (or an error), move up to**<www.web.com/a/>** . This should lead you toward what you're looking for or confirm that it's no longer available.  
 If you have moved up to the website's home page, try to run a search for the information you're looking for. If the site doesn't have a search function, try navigating to the page you want using category links to dig deeper into the site.
4. Search for the page from a[popular search engine](https://www.lifewire.com/best-search-engines-2483352) . It's possible that you simply have the entirely wrong URL in which case a quick Google or Bing search should get you where you want to go.  
 If you do find the page you were after, update your bookmark or favorite to avoid the HTTP 404 error in the future.
5. [Clear your browser's cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) if you have any indication that the 404 message might just be yours. For example, if you can reach the URL from your phone but not from your tablet, clearing the cache on your tablet's browser might help.  
 You might also consider[clearing your browser's cookies](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981) or at least the one(s) involved with the website in question if clearing the cache didn't work.
6. [Change the DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-server-settings-2617979) used by your computer, but usually only if an entire website gives you a 404 error, especially if the website is available to those on other networks (e.g., your mobile phone network or a friend in another city).  
 Sitewide 404s errors on a website aren't common unless your[ISP](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) or government filters/censors websites. No matter the reason, if it does happen, giving another set of[DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-server-2625854) a try is a good step to take. See our[Free and Public DNS Servers List](https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062) for some alternatives and instructions on doing this.
7. Contact the website directly. If they've removed the page you're after, then the 404 error is completely legitimate, and they should be able to tell you that. If they've_moved_ the page and are generating errors instead of redirecting visitors to the new page, they'll be happy to hear from you so they can fix it.  
 If you suspect everyone is getting a 404 error for this site, but you're not sure, a quick check on X (formerly Twitter) might help clear it up. All you have to do is search X for_#websitedown_ , as in[#facebookdown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/facebookdown?lang=en) or[#youtubedown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/youtubedown) . Users on X are usually the first to start talking about a website outage. Learn[how to tell if a website is down for everyone or just you](https://www.lifewire.com/is-website-down-3482172) for some more help.
8. Finally, if all else fails, wait. No, it's not fun, but it might be your only course of action, especially if you're confident the 404 error shouldn't be happening (i.e., the page really should be at the URL you have and others are having the same problem and find it equally strange).

 You can find 404 errors on your own website through tools like[DeadLinkChecker.com](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/website-dead-link-checker.asp) and[ATOMSEO](https://error404.atomseo.com/) .

## Cause of HTTP 404 Errors

 Technically, an Error 404 is a client-side error, implying that it's your mistake, either because you mistyped the[URL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-url-2626035) or the page has been moved or removed from the website, and you should have known.

 Another possibility is if a website has moved a page or resource without redirecting the old URL to the new one. When that happens, you'll receive a 404 error instead of being automatically routed to the new page.

 Microsoft IIS web servers sometimes give more specific information about the cause of 404 Not Found errors by suffixing a number after the_404_ , as in_HTTP Error 404.3 - Not Found_ , which means_MIME type restriction_ .
