## Effective Methods to Recover Mss32.dll - No More Missing Files Issues
 Mss32.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the mss32 DLL file, a Miles Sound System DLL file that some software programs and video games use to load sound files.  

 The error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's operating systems, including Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.

## How to Fix Mss32.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download mss32.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons[why downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mss32.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mss32.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![mss32.dll file in recycle bin](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BFreI6joymY1ydAOY-pM5YboEAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mss32-dll-recycle-bin-restore-dcd0746c1f1a444c8cc4ca0999ab2820.png)  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . But only do this if you're sure you deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before that.  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the mss32.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Steam is a common application that experiences mss32.dll errors, so if that's the program you're seeing the DLL error in,[reinstalling Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) may prove to be very helpful.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the mss32.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Verify the integrity of the Steam game cache](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB) . This step is clearly only applicable if your mss32.dll errors are related to a Steam game.  
 If this step doesn't clear the error, navigate to the folder on your computer that the game files are stored in, delete the "bin" folder, and then re-verify the game cache.[Follow these instructions from Steam Community](https://web.archive.org/web/20170603075515/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=33249463&postcount=8) (that's an archived version of the page) for more specific steps on doing that.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mss32.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to this DLL file. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file mss32.dll is missing" error when you play a video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[sound card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sound-card-2618160) .  
 The mss32.dll file may or may not be related to your sound card drivers or software installationâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if mss32.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
8. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mss32.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Mss32.dll Error Messages

 In some cases, mss32.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure, but chances are the file is just corrupt or missing.
