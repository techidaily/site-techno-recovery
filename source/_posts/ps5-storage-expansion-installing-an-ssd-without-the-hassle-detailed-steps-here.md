##  How to Upgrade the Storage in Your PS5 

 You will have to do just a little bit of work before installing your new PS5 SSD, but it’s all fairly simple stuff.  

![PS5 console with screwdriver](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XXKHwgpM2md1Xu4n4EEOgcKyPVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ps501-02002ff9be6f4acbbefc04892912fa26.JPG)

[ Sony says](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#:~:text=Will%20installing%20an%20M.2%20SSD%20affect%20my%20warranty?) that as long as you follow installation instructions and use an SSD with the recommended specs, installing a new SSD will not void the manufacturer’s warranty.

1. Turn on the PS5 (if it’s brand new, hook it up and then turn it on) and[ update the console’s firmware](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/) to the latest version.
2. Once the PS5 is updated, shut the console down (be sure to turn it off completely, not just put it in Sleep Mode) and disconnect all cables. You should also let the console sit for a few minutes so that it cools down.
3. Move the PS5 to a large, flat, clean surface to work on it. Make sure you have plenty of light and a #1 cross-head or Phillips screwdriver.
4. Touch something metal that’s grounded to dissipate any possible static electric buildup.

 Installing an SSD in your PS5 for the first time will require formatting, which the PS5 will prompt you for once the process is finished. If you have anything saved to the SSD that you want to keep, make sure to copy or transfer it before you install it in the PS5.

 The next steps will depend on whether you have a launch version or the newer Slim model of the PS5.

##  How to Install a New SSD in a PS5 Launch Console 

 With your PS5 console, clean surface, and screwdriver ready, it’s time to get to work.  

1. Remove the base by removing the single screw, and then set the base aside.  
 Place the PS5 in front of you with the front of the console (with the power button and controller port) facing you. You’ll also want the bottom of the console facing up (i.e., the PlayStation logo should be facing down).

2. Get your fingers under the top-left corner of the PS5’s cover, gently pull up, and then slide it to the right to unseat it.

3. Slowly slide the cover piece off to remove it entirely.
4. Find the expansion slot (a long and narrow metal cover) toward the front of the open console, just in front of the fan exhaust.  
![A launch-edition PS5 with the expansion slot highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kTNrs6Qh5WU9sU3JA63Mi2BGCCw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/PS5-Launch-expansion-slot-41533e8c65cf4aa587b0fc842768777d.jpg)  
Rob Rich/Lifewire
5. Loosen and remove the expansion slot’s screw (with the PlayStation symbols on it), and then pull the slot cover slightly to your left and lift it off.

6. Remove the smaller expansion slot screw along with the metal spacer ring beneath it.

Rob Rich/Lifewire
7. Line the spacer ring up with the expansion slow screw hole that matches the size of your SSD. You may want to hold the SSD up to the expansion slot to double-check the fit.

8. Line up the SSD connectors with the expansion connectors in the expansion slot and push it into place, leveling out the SSD as you go. Make sure to push the SSD firmly into place and that the end lines up with the spacer ring.

Rob Rich/Lifewire
9. Screw the small expansion slot screw back into place, lining it up with the end of the SSD and the spacer ring.  
![screwing in the new SSD](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ar4eheOHhRZ2zVXiF0ZbH88QH6Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ps512-cb195b4417ff4b7cb65efcfb64b16f5e.JPG)  
Rob Rich/Lifewire
10. Slide the expansion slot cover into place, and then screw the larger expansion slot screw (with all the PlayStation symbols) back in.  
![replacing expansion slot cover](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hVZMs2-ruRXal1s4skWfgrQQHKw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ps506-9a137d0f02c84ffaa7f8d7d742c3afd2.JPG)  
Rob Rich/Lifewire
11. Line the exterior cover piece up with the bottom of the PS5, but about a half-inch or so to the right. Place the cover down and then slide it to the left until it clicks back into place.  
![replacing PS5 console bottom cover](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hZFwbSRXskuakN5rDw8Z6Eakcc4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ps514-ffc1fd3ad1d248509a699df5806e9471.JPG)  
Rob Rich/Lifewire
12. Put your PS5 back into its usual place and reconnect all the cables, and then turn it on. If you’ve never used this SSD in a PS5 before and you see a formatting prompt, that means the installation was a success.
13. Follow the on-screen prompts to format and start using your SSD. If the SSD was already formatted for PS5, verify recognition by opening**Settings** \>**Storage** \> and looking for**M.2SSD Storage** in the menu.

 If you can’t get the expansion slot cover to line up or close, the SSD is likely too big, and you’ll need to choose an alternate model.

##  How to Install a New SSD in a PS5 Slim 

 The SSD installation process on a[ PS5 Slim](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-slim-7966360) is very similar to that of a non-Slim PS5, with the biggest difference being the process of removing the cover.  

![illustration of PS5 Slim front, indicating the panel that will be removed to install the SSD](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/f6bLu_EsgvJLtHFPsDZzzFgW1kw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/pa5slim01-efec593ba589438cb3d7b29417322c62.jpeg)

1. Shut off the console (not Sleep Mode; turn it off completely), disconnect all the cables, and give the PS5 a few minutes to cool down.
2. Once you flip the PS5 upside-down (with the Power button facing you), look at the left-hand side (the one with a Triangle symbol). Get your fingers under the front lip of the bottom cover piece and gently pull out and up to disconnect the internal clips.
3. Tilt the cover piece up and back until you can slide the clips at the backside out, and then remove the cover entirely.
4. Locate the white expansion port, which has PS symbols on it, and remove the main screw. Lift off the cover.
5. Remove the inner screw and spacer ring.
6. Insert the new SSD and seat it into the socket on the right, making sure one of the expansion screw holes lines up with the other edge.
7. Replace the inner screw.
8. Put the expansion slot cover back on and secure it with the larger screw.
9. Reattach the PS5 cover by first lining up the hooks towards the back side with their correct openings. Lower the cover piece over the PS5 and push it back into place along the front of the console until it clicks.
10. Now, you can reconnect the console’s support legs, plug everything back in, and turn it on. Follow any prompts to format the new SSD, and then go to**System** \>**Storage** to ensure the console recognizes it.

##  Which SSDs Are Compatible With the PS5? 

 Before you order a new SSD for your PS5—let alone open up the console—you’ll want to make sure the drive is compatible. You can find comprehensive lists all over the internet from reputable sources like[ IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd) , but there are some things to keep in mind if you decide to set out on your own:

* It needs to be an[ M.2 SSD](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453) , but not a SATA M.2 SSD, as Sony states that[ SATA drives are not compatible](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min:~:text=devices%20are%20supported.-,M.2%20SATA%20SSDs%20aren%E2%80%99t%20supported.,-You%20should%20carefully) with the PS5.
* The form factor type must be numbered 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280, or 22110.
* Width cannot exceed 25mm, length can’t go beyond 110mm, and thickness can’t be more than 11.25mm.
* Sony recommends a read speed of at least 5,500 MB per second.
* Storage should be no less than 250 GB and no more than 8 TB.

 I recommend the[ Corsair MP600 PRO LPX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09Q2NCFS7/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8662653%7Cnc2c7794697264495acf0ee6dc4e7a99804%7C) , which as of writing, has thus far been performing admirably for close to a year after initial installation.

## Troubleshooting Tips 

 There’s a small chance that following all the directions, hooking the PS5 back up, and turning it back on results in the new SSD not being recognized. If this happens, don’t panic: It’s more likely due to a loose connection than any busted or incompatible hardware.  

 Shut down the PS5, unplug everything, and then open it back up like you did for the SSD installation. Carefully pull out the SSD, and then push it back in (this time pushing a bit more firmly than last time). When you think it’s in there solidly, close the PS5 back up and plug everything back in. Now, the console should recognize the drive.  

 If the PS5 still doesn’t recognize the SSD, double-check the specifications in case it’s not compatible. You may also want to shut down, disconnect, and re-open the PS5 to inspect the SSD’s contacts for any signs of dirt or debris. If anything looks dirty, carefully clean it out with some isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab.
