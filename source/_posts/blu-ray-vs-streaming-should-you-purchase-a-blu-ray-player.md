## How to Combine Two Playlists on Spotify With the Desktop App

## Can You Add a Whole Playlist to Another Playlist on Spotify?  

 Spotify limits playlists to 10,000 songs, so as long as you don’t exceed that number, you should have no trouble copying an entire playlist into another one. Follow the instructions outlined above to do this on desktop or mobile.
