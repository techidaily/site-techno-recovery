_Skype can’t connect_

 Skype sure is making our lives so much easier. But there are times when you can’t connect to Skype, and you’re seeing the message saying**_Sorry, we couldn’t connect to Skype_** , you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Check Skype Heartbeat](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Upgrade Skype to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 3:[Check for Available Windows Update](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 4:[Refresh Network Settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 5:[Update Network Card Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check Skype Heartbeat

 If Skype is suddenly down, most of the case, the problem is not on your side. It could be Skype that is having issues. You can check Skype’s status by:

 1) Open Skype. Click**Help** , then**Heartbeat** .

 3) If you do see message concerning connection problem, all you can do is to wait for Skype technicians to solve it on their end.
