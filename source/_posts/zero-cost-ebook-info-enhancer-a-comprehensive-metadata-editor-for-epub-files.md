Well, this is about the same as Calibre...  
 I would love to have a metadata editor that can just edit the metadata and nothing else. Having my books messed up on my reader because the title is too long or in the wrong order because of the way the metadata has been used is a pain (and a lot of work to fix!)

What do you mean it's the same as Calibre? Does it create copies of books in its own library?

This software only allows you edit the metadata, not create a new copy of ebook.

 If you are looking for some software to manage your ebooks, please check Epubor eBook Manager https://www.epubor.com/ebook-manager.html. It will never let you down.

Yes, exactly. Do you think there is a need to download a 29 MB package to change a few words in an XML file?

Deceitful: claims to be free yet after downloading & installation demands payment for it to be used.

does the metadata persist regardless of the reader/lib app i use for my library? i ask bcz when i use certain mp3 taggers, then i open with diff music apps, some of them cant read the data, others convert to add special characters, which i hate, and others dont allow for all the fields i set up in the tagger. after about 20 years of pdfs, doc, txt, lit, mobi, epub, ect...you can imagine i dont want to have to edit the data only to find my kindle apps dont organize the library the same way my desktop apps do. tyia
