## 2023'S Top Offline Car Racing Apps: Free Titles That Deliver Ultimate Thrills

Close 

 One of the best innovations in free car racing video games has been the addition of online leaderboards, multiplayer races, and even persistent open worlds for players to explore in their virtual cars.

 However, these exciting features have a cost in that their implementation requires that the games be online at all times to function correctly.

 Thankfully, several good offline racing games are still worth playing on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles. Here are ten free offline titles worth downloading today.

## [ Most Popular Free Racing Game: Asphalt 8: Airborne](http://www.gameloft.com/asphalt8/) 

![A screenshot of Asphalt 8](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-dZlweiPK0Pd2K8FPUBgS05YX2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/offlinecars-asphalt8-5bf393bb46e0fb002650eb20.jpg) 

Gamesloft

 What We Like

* An impressive amount of content for a free game.
* Good variety of locations for each race track.

 What We Don't Like

* Younger players may tap in-game ads accidentally.
* The realistic art style may not appeal to all players.

 The Asphalt racing games are easily some of the most popular offline car games on iOS and Android._Asphalt 8: Airborne_ is one of the best in the series, as it features over 220 cars and bikes and lets players play entirely offline.

 A newer Asphalt game,_Asphalt 9: Legends_ , is available, but it requires a constant online connection.

_Asphalt 8: Airborne_ does contain an online multiplayer mode, but its single-player career mode is entirely playable without connecting to a Wi-Fi signal.

**Download For:** 

[ iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-8-airborne/id610391947?platform=iphone) 

[ Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM)

## [ Most Stylish Racer: Hovercraft: Takedown](http://www.highscorehero.com/hovercraft-takedown.html) 

![A screenshot of Hovercraft: Takedown](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GEUtW11DJE_gQAZCHothcUkLeUs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/offlinecars-hovercraft-5bf395dc46e0fb002665d1cd.jpg) 

High Score Hero

 What We Like

* The iOS version also works on Apple TVs.
* Encourages creativity in younger players.

 What We Don't Like

* In-app purchases for rare hovercrafts.
* The number of ads can be annoying.

_Hovercraft: Takedown_ is a fun, free-to-play racing game that lets players create custom hovercrafts. Vehicles can change their colors and shapes, and even the type of weapons.

 While_Hovercraft: Takedown_ is one of the few racing games that doesn't require Wi-Fi to access most of its content, those wanting to play its multiplayer must go online.

**Download For:**

Soner Kara

 What We Like

* Game modes and upgradable vehicles offer variety.
* Easy controls make it great for younger players.

 What We Don't Like

* The environments are a bit boring to look at.
* No actual race tracks.

_Traffic Racer_ is like an endless runner video game but with cars. Players can choose from over 30 vehicles to drive on a freeway and must dodge traffic by swiping left or right on the screen or tilting the smartphone or tablet to steer.

 This offline car game appears to be very basic at first glance, but it offers some customization options for the cars and various upgrade options that encourage players to keep racing.

Part Time Monkey Oy

 What We Like

* Controls are very easy to pick up.
* You learn about real locations while playing.

 What We Don't Like

* Gameplay can get a little repetitive.
* Graphics are very simple compare to other titles.

_Great Race — Route 66_ is a very simple car racing game that takes players through the[ real-world Route 66 road in the United States](https://www.historic66.com/) . Short swipes of the finger to the right or left control the vehicles, and there are 15 classic cars to unlock.

 While Great Race may have a very simplified design, there's a strong focus on realism with a real-time day/night cycle that changes while you play and a variety of real locations to unlock.

 What We Like

* Focus on drifting sets this game apart.
* Cool music with a high production value.

 What We Don't Like

* Casual gamers will find this game hard or frustrating.
* Main menu can be a bit confusing to navigate at first.

_CarX Drift Racing 2_ features a realistic visual style that resembles the_Forza_ and_Asphalt_ car racing games but sets itself apart by its challenging driving style that incorporates slippery roads and requires frequent drifting to make it to the finish line.

 Naturally, online multiplayer is unavailable while offline, but the Drift, Time Attack, and Training modes are fully accessible and provide a lot of content for those who like this particular driving style.
