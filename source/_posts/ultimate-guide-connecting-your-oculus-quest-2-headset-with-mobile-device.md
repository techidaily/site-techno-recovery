 If you have trouble connecting your Quest 2 to your iPhone, make sure[ Bluetooth is enabled on your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-bluetooth-on-off-ipad-1994643) before you start the process. Bluetooth should be enabled before you attempt to pair your iPhone to a Quest 2.

##  Why Pair a Quest 2 to a Phone?

 Pairing your Quest 2 with a phone provides a number of benefits.

 Without having to wear your headset, the app allows you to purchase apps and games, check your friends list, view a gallery of screenshots and videos you’ve taken on the headset, and even view a live stream from the headset.

 The live stream option is beneficial if you want to share your VR experience with someone else.

 If your Quest 2 and phone are paired, you can select the stream option, and your view is mirrored from the headset to your phone screen. That allows a friend to see exactly what you see while you’re playing.

 You can also record gameplay to your phone for easy playback on a computer or share with friends outside the Facebook ecosystem. While the Quest 2 does allow you to share screencaps and clips, it’s limited to[ Facebook](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-3486391) and[ Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) .

 Pairing your Quest 2 to a phone is also necessary if you want to use[ Quest 2 parental controls](https://www.lifewire.com/use-parental-controls-on-quest-6260333) . Your teen's phone must pair to the Quest 2 to initiate a request. You can then accept the request on your phone, which allows you to monitor your child's VR usage, pick which games they’re allowed to play, and adjust other settings.
