## Choosing Wisely: How Does an iPad Pro Stack Up Against a MacBook Air?

 The iPad Pro and MacBook Air are lightweight, ultra-portable Apple mobile computing and entertainment products. They both use apps, stream audio and video, play games, and support communication tools like FaceTime and Messages, but they have some key differences. This article pits the[**MacBook Air**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8655681%7Cn14358b5647f64473b5874b54768e2eff02%7C) vs.[**iPad Pro**](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J7FC1P?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8655681%7Cn14358b5647f64473b5874b54768e2eff02%7C) to see how they're similar and different and helps you understand which is best for you.

## Overall Findings

 iPad Pro

* Runs iPadOS, uses iPad apps.
* Like a big iPhone.
* Weighs around 1 pound.
* 11- or 13-inch screen.
* Touchscreen.
* Battery lasts the length of the work day.
* Front and back cameras.
* Keyboard is an add-on.

 MacBook Air

* Runs macOS, uses Mac apps.
* A laptop.
* Weighs around 3 pounds.
* 13- or 15-inch screen.
* No touchscreen.
* Battery lasts most of a full day.
* User-facing camera.
* Built-in keyboard.

 While the iPad Pro and MacBook Air are both great, their most important difference is that the Pro is a tablet, while the Air is a laptop. That difference has a lot of implications. It says something about the expected uses for each device, where you might use them, how portable and interactive they are, and what features each offers.

 Their hardware is a bit different, too. The iPad has a touchscreen and works with the[Apple Pencil](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-apple-pencil-5190247) , while the MacBook doesn't ([at least, not yet](https://www.lifewire.com/touchscreen-macbook-8640916) ). However, the MacBook Air has a battery that lasts a lot longer than the iPad's.

 For most people, the Air could be the only computer you own. For the Pro to be your only computer, though, you'll probably need some add-ons, like a keyboard.  

## Screen: Size for the Mac, Touch for the iPad

 iPad Pro

* Two screen sizes, including the smallest option of the two devices.
* Touchscreen.
* OLED Retina Display with TrueTone color.
* Apple Pencil support.

 MacBook Air

* Two screen sizes, including the largest option of the two devices.
* No touchscreen.
* LED Retina Display with TrueTone color.
* No Apple Pencil support.

 The iPad Pro has a more impressive, more feature-packed screen, while the MacBook Air offers larger display sizes. The iPad has a touchscreen that works with the Apple Pencil, but the MacBook Air's screen is just for looking at.

 The iPad's screen is lit with bright, battery-friendly OLED technology. The MacBook's screen is no slouch—it's a great-looking, super-sharp[Retina Display](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-retina-display-2000362) —and is typically bigger than the iPad's.

## Keyboard and Mouse: Built-In vs. Add On

 iPad Pro

* Keyboard add-ons with case or external.
* Mouse add-on, but support is limited.

 MacBook Air

* Built-in keyboard.
* Built-in trackpad mouse.

 If you plan to write a lot on your device, a keyboard is crucial. The MacBook Air has a built-in keyboard and mouse that deliver a smooth, efficient experience at no extra cost, so it's the better option out of the box.

 The iPad gives you more flexibility—you can choose your keyboard and mouse, including an ultra-portable keyboard case—but these will be separate purchases. The iPad isn't really designed for[use with a mouse](https://www.lifewire.com/use-mouse-with-ipad-4767001) (that's what the touchscreen is for), so that experience is less polished.

## Cameras: iPad Offers More Cameras and Higher Resolution

 iPad Pro

* Two cameras: one facing the user, one on the back.
* Supports FaceTime.
* Takes still photos or records video at up to 4K resolution.
* Flash, low-light features, zoom.

 MacBook Air

* One camera, facing the user.
* Supports FaceTime.
* Takes still photos and records video at 1080p resolution.
* No flash or low-light options, no zoom.

 Both devices' cameras can take photos and videos, and they support[FaceTime](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facetime-2000237) video calls, but the iPad Pro has two cameras and captures higher-resolution images.

 The MacBook Air has one camera, facing the user, while the iPad Pro has a user-facing camera and a back camera for photos and videos that aren't selfies.

 The MacBook's camera is good for video calls, but its placement makes photography and video difficult.[The iPad camera](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ways-to-use-ipad-camera-4176324) is better equipped due to the camera's placement, more portable profile, its ability to capture high-resolution video, and great low-light photography features.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Networking: Only the iPad Has Cellular

 iPad Pro

* Wi-Fi.
* Bluetooth.
* Optional 5G cellular.

 MacBook Air

* Wi-Fi.
* Bluetooth.

 Both devices can connect to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but only the iPad Pro has optional 5G cellular connectivity. That means that you can use the iPad anywhere there's a cellular signal, like an iPhone, with no Wi-Fi needed. This can be really helpful, but the cellular iPads cost more, and you'll need a monthly phone plan to use 5G.

## Memory and Storage: Pretty Even Choices

 iPad Pro

* Up to 16GB RAM.
* Up to 2TB hard drive.

 MacBook Air

* Up to 24GB RAM.
* Up to 2TB hard drive.

 Both the MacBook Air and iPad Pro offer almost identical options for RAM and hard drive storage. Because of differences in its software, the iPad doesn't need as much RAM as the Mac, but the Mac typically has a higher capacity. Both have the same options for hard drive storage.

## Other Factors: Colors, Ports, Battery, Audio

 iPad Pro

* Fewer USB ports, headphone jack; physical volume buttons.
* Battery lasts the length of the work day.
* 6 speakers, Spatial Audio with AirPods.

 MacBook Air

* More USB ports, headphone jack.
* Battery lasts most of a full day.
* 4 speakers, Surround Sound, Spatial Audio with AirPods.

 There are a lot of other small ways that the MacBook Air and iPad Pro differ—too many to include in this article, actually (and many of them probably won't matter to the average user). A few interesting factors are included here.

 The MacBook Air has more ports for connecting peripherals like printers and monitors than the iPad, which makes it more suited to being the center of a fully equipped workspace. The MacBook also has a larger, longer-lasting battery (but the[iPad's battery lasts plenty long](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ipad-battery-life-tips-1999807) ) and delivers better audio playback than the iPad.

## Final Verdict: Two Great Options, So Try Before You Buy

 It's no surprise that the[**MacBook Air**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23GFMJ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8655681%7Cn14358b5647f64473b5874b54768e2eff02%7C) and[**iPad Pro**](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-13-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J7ZX58?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8655681%7Cn14358b5647f64473b5874b54768e2eff02%7C) are similar. Apple makes both devices, and they have the same design principles and ecosystem features (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, iCloud, etc.). Which device makes sense for you depends on how you want to use it.

 For simple tasks—email, writing, web browsing, games, streaming audio and video—the iPad Pro may be better. It's super portable, less expensive, and plenty powerful. With a keyboard case, it makes for a tidy little powerhouse.

 For more complex tasks and things that need more processing power—like video editing, image editing, and audio production—the MacBook Air might be a bit better (though a[MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-5120274) would be even better).

 Still, some people prefer an iPad as their only computing device, no matter what they do with it, while others use a MacBook for simple tasks. Our recommendation? Spend time using them in an[Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/retail/) or borrow one from a friend or family member to see what you like best.
