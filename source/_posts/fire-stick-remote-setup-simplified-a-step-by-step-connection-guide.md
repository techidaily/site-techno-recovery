* To start the pairing process, unplug your Fire Stick from power and remove the batteries from the remote.
* Plug the Fire Stick in and replace the batteries, then press and hold the home button on the remote to initiate pairing.

## How to Pair a Fire Stick Remote to a TV

 Many Fire TV remotes are interchangeable, but not all. If you’re replacing a lost or broken remote, make sure the replacement is compatible with both your Fire Stick model and generation.

 To pair a Fire Stick remote, you need to restart your Fire Stick and put the remote into pairing mode as the Fire Stick is starting back up. Once the Fire Stick has started back up, it will be paired with the remote.

 This process is exactly the same whether you’re pairing the remote that originally came with the Fire Stick or a compatible replacement.

 Here’s how to pair a Fire Stick remote:  

1. Unplug your Fire Stick from power.

2. Remove the batteries from your Fire Stick remote.

 If the batteries are old, consider replacing them at this time so you don't have to go through this procedure again when they die.
3. Plug the Fire Stick back into power.

4. Put the batteries back in your Fire Stick remote, or install fresh batteries if it's a new remote.

## Can You Pair a Fire Stick Remote to a Different Fire Stick?

 There are several Fire Stick remote models, and they aren’t all interchangeable. So while you can pair a Fire Stick remote to a different Fire Stick, you can only do so if the remote and Fire Stick are compatible.

 For example, the 2nd generation Alexa Voice Remote isn’t compatible with the 1st or 2nd generation Amazon Fire TV, the 1st generation Fire Stick, or Fire TV Edition smart TVs, but it does work with other models.

 There’s no easy way to determine compatibility, so the safest option is to check with Amazon. Fire Stick remote listings on Amazon typically provide a list of compatible devices, and Amazon customer support can also provide further assistance if you aren’t sure.

 It doesn’t hurt to try pairing a remote if you already have one, but don’t buy a replacement until you’ve verified compatibility.

 Your Fire Stick can be paired to up to seven remotes, but each remote can only be paired to one Fire TV. If you pair a Fire Stick remote to a different Fire Stick, it will stop working with the original Fire Stick.
