## Streamline Your Calls: Connect Multiple Gadgets Using a Single Phone Number Technique
 For some people, it's important to have multiple phones ring on a single incoming call. This means that when a certain phone number is called, several devices ring at once instead of only one. This article explains how to do this using your mobile carrier or an app.

## Wireless Carrier

 Some mobile carriers allow you to use your number with multiple devices. With these services, you can forward incoming calls automatically to all your devices, including your phone, smartwatch, or tablet.

[AT&T NumberSync](https://www.att.com/features/numbersync/) lets you use a compatible device to answer your calls even if your phone is off or not with you. Two similar devices include [DIGITS from T-Mobile](https://digits.t-mobile.com/) and [Verizon One Talk](https://www.verizon.com/support/one-talk/) .

 The same feature might already be enabled on your iPhone or iPad. As long as the person is calling you over [FaceTime](https://www.lifewire.com/facetime-on-iphone-ipod-touch-2000760) , or you have hardware that meets[continuity system requirements for the iPhone Cellular Calls feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102405) , you can answer the call on your other Apple devices, including your Mac.

## Google Voice

 The free Google Voice service has revolutionized the "one number to ring them all" idea.

 Google Voice (available for Android and iOS) offers a[free phone number](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-free-phone-number-3426654) that rings multiple phones simultaneously, along with a package of other features, including voicemail, voice-to-text transcription, [call recording](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-record-call-with-google-voice-3426756) , conferencing, special call-handling rules for both individual and groups of contacts, and visual voicemail.

## Phonebooth

 Phonebooth is a serious alternative to Google Voice and is full of features. The[Find Me Follow Me feature routes your calls](https://phonebooth.com/find-me-follow-me/) to other phones if you want it to. Phonebook also offers voice-to-text transcription, an auto attendant, and a click-to-call widget.

 Although[it costs to use Phonebook](https://phonebooth.com/business-phone-plans/) , the service offers competitive calling rates, comparable to other VoIP players on the market. It's a single price for unlimited calls in the continental U.S., and you pay only for the number of users you need ($20 each).

## Install a Voice Calling App

 Some apps give you your own phone number while others aren't technically phones (because there isn't a number) but do let you accept calls from multiple devices, including phones, tablets, and computers.

 For example,[these apps that can make free calls](https://www.lifewire.com/free-internet-phone-calls-1356646) work with other users of those same apps, but because the programs are compatible with multiple platforms, you can get your calls to ring on all devices at once.

 As an example, you can install the[Talkatone](https://www.talkatone.com/) app to get a free phone number that comes with the ability to call most landlines and cell phones in the U.S. Sign in to your account on your tablet and phone to have calls go to both devices.

 These types of apps don't let you forward your "main" phone number to other devices.

## Why Would You Ring Two Phones With the Same Number?

 Maybe you want your home phone, office phone, and mobile phone to ring at the same time. This makes you less likely to miss important calls. The setup also lets you choose where to talk based on the nature of the call.

 Traditionally, this type of situation calls for a[PBX configuration](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-pbx-phone-system-3426315) , which is expensive both as a service and in terms of equipment. The huge investment is a deterrent which explains why it's a fairly rare setup.

 With one number, you can configure a series of devices to ring whenever there's an incoming call. We're not talking about having one line with different branches and phone terminals but, instead, several independent devices ringing, and the freedom to choose which one to answer.

 FAQ

* How can I call two phone numbers at the same time?  
 Most modern smartphones have an**Add Call** button you can press once you connect to the first number you dial—just press that and ring up the other number you want to include, then press**Merge** (or**Merge calls** on iOS). You can also merge a current call with an incoming call by putting the original call on hold to answer the new one, then selecting**Merge** or**Merge calls** .
* Can I listen in on a phone call from a different phone?  
 Unlike[landlines](https://www.lifewire.com/are-you-calls-secure-on-landline-or-voip-3426537) that let someone listen in just by picking up a second phone on the same connection, modern smartphones don't allow for unwanted eavesdropping through another device. Unless they're intentionally added or merged, that is. Though it is possible for someone to listen in on a call if your phone has been compromised with spyware or other types of malware.
