### ZDNET's key takeaways

* The [AGM X6 Phantom](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007354515299.html) is available for just $182.
* The clear back panel is interesting, the phone boasts a high level of durability, and the large capacity battery keeps it going for nearly two days.
* The single rear camera isn't going to help you win contests, and the LCD isn't as brilliant as the OLED in other models.

Affordable Android phones of the past were riddled with bloatware, but mid-rangers today often offer a nearly stock Android experience. The new [AGM X6 Phantom](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007354515299.html) is running the latest Android 14 operating system and unlike a [Samsung phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/), it only comes with stock Google apps and one utility for its temperature sensor.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS AGM X6 Phantom The AGM X6 Phantom is an affordable rugged phone with a clear back that lets you see what its made of. View at Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007354515299.html)

AGM tries to differentiate the X6 Phantom a bit with a cool transparent black panel that offers you a glimpse of the internal hardware of the phone. The corners are further protected with TPU rubber material while the polycarbonate casing adds to the durability proven with MIL-STD-810H, IP68, and IP69K (high pressure jet) certifications.

It's a [rugged phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-rugged-phone/) that can handle what you throw at it without adding substantial bulk or weight. Thin metal rails line the two sides to add rigidity, too.

The clear back panel easily reveals the antenna, chipset, NFC module, large capacity 5,000 mAh battery, and flexible cables. We've seen skins with similar internal hardwareâ€”it's always interesting to see how things are arranged inside a smartphone.

The temperature sensor is the lower right circular opening just below the 50MP main camera. You can use it to measure the temperature of your body by pointing it at your forehead or wrist, or the temperature of objects around you. SI and metric units are available for your measurements, with the sensor supporting a range from -22 degrees F to 572 degrees F, neither limit of which I ever expect to hit.

The 50MP rear main camera, which also supports night vision, will capture good-quality images in well-lit environments. The colors are not vibrant but fairly cool, and there's no telephoto or macro support. The front-facing camera is a 16MP shooter with basic results, but it works fine for video calling.

128GB of internal storage, plus support for microSD cards, gives you plenty of room to run multiple apps and store large files. The 8GB of RAM and internal storage speeds are typical for [affordable phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-cheap-phones/).

A MediaTek Dimensity T750 processor powers the Android 14 experience, and for typical daily functions, the system works well. This chip also supports 5G connections with supported carriers, but there may be frequency limitations with some carriers.

The 6.78 inch LCD has a 2,460 x 1,080 resolution and is fine for watching shows and YouTube videos. The dual stereo speakers perform well with good volume and quality music playback. There's a 3.5mm audio port on the bottom if you still have a pair of wired headphones lying around and prefer them over Bluetooth headsets.

I was very pleased to see AGM implement the fingerprint sensor in the right-side power button, as my thumb naturally rests there while holding the phone in my right hand. There is an additional button on the left side that you can customize to launch the temperature utility, turn on the flashlight, or launch the camera.

## ZDNET's buying advice

If you are looking for an affordable rugged phone that has the latest version of Android and a big display, the [AGM X6 Phantom](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007354515299.html) is a good option. The display isn't as brilliant as [the newest smartphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) and the camera is limited, but battery life is great and it provides a basic Android experience.

It is not easy to stand out in a world of glass slabs, but the AGM X6 Phantom lets you see what is inside your phone. It's an interesting rugged device that bares it all while still being able to withstand drops, water, and more. Overall, it's an affordable, rugged device with a basic camera and user experience.
