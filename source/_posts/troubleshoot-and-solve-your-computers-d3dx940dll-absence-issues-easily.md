## How to Fix D3dx9\_40.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download d3dx9\_40.dll individually from any "DLL download site." It's usually[not recommended to download a DLL file like that](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, remove it immediately from wherever you put it and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The d3dx9\_40.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, this will fix the "d3dx9\_40.dll not found" error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.  
 Usually, if a game or​ another program uses DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc. For example, if you're using the game with[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) , it's probably called_DXSETUP.exe_ , and can be found in a_redist_ folder in the game's installation directory. If you can't find it manually, try searching your entire computer for "dxsetup.exe" using a file search tool like[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) .  
 Another example is the GB-ASManager program. When the DLL error is seen there, reinstall the software included on the associated DVD.
4. [Uninstall and then reinstall the game or software program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_40.dll, and a reinstallation could do the trick.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_40.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) from the latest DirectX package. If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your d3dx9\_40.dll error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for your video card. While it's not the most common solution, in some situations, updating the video card[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.
