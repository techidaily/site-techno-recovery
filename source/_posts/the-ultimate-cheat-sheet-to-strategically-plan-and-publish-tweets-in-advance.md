##  What Happened to Tweetdeck? 

 The best option for pre-writing posts used to be Tweetdeck, a free client that also let you manage several feeds and accounts simultaneously. It also supported scheduling when the Twitter website didn't.

 However, when Twitter became X, Tweetdeck changed to "X Pro." Unfortunately, it also stopped being free. You can't use X Pro without an X Premium membership, which has a monthly fee.

 Luckily, however, scheduling came to the web version of X, and Tweetdeck/X Pro aren't necessary.
