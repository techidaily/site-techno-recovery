## The Complete Guide to Rectifying dsound.dll File Unavailability on PCs
 Dsound.dll issues are caused in one way or another by an issue with Microsoft DirectX.

 The dsound.dll file is one of many files contained in the DirectX software collection. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows-based games and advanced graphics programs, dsound.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

 Any of Microsoft's operating systems since Windows 98 may be affected by dsound.dll and other DirectX issues. This includes Windows 11, 10, 8, etc.

## How to Fix Dsound.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download the dsound.dll file individually from any "DLL download site." There are a number of reasons[why download DLLs like that is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, delete it immediately and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The dsound.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version will fix the dsound.dll not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the dsound.dll error you're receiving, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or other program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of it on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Reinstall the game or software program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the program files that work with dsound.dll and a reinstall could do the trick.
5. [Restore the dsound.dll file from the latest DirectX software package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your error, try extracting the DLL file individually from the DirectX downloadable package.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for your video card. While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.
7. [Run System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to restore your computer to a point in time when the error wasn't occurring. If you're able to, this should restore the file and fix the errors.
