## Choosing the Right Champion: Google Pixel 7 Pro vs Apple iPhone 1

![Google Pixel 7 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/3bcbb7abee90da84d8d101355bbb0ac003ee942d/2023/02/10/8a22f60a-6621-43f0-8a9b-ccf5d48ed5ed/google-pixel-7-pro-vs-iphone-14-pro.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

It takes a lot of courage to slap a "Pro" label on the back of a smartphone. For one, there are high expectations for the handset to deliver on virtually all fronts: display technology, battery life, performance, and cameras especially. Secondly, that Pro branding, usually served with an expensive market price, should offer something new and innovative, whether it be [a transformative camera feature](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review/), [a foldable design](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review/), or a "[Dynamic Island](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-makes-the-notch-come-alive-finally/)."

If you're in the market for a high-end phone, then Google's latest [Pixel 7 Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0BCQWYR2Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C2cb9dabf-aabb-428e-8bb6-45ad3afd4cd8%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and Apple's [iPhone 14 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) should be near, if not at, the top of the list. 

Both devices offer the best of their respective brands, including unique features and strong after-sales service, and have proven to be worthy of their Pro labels.

## You should buy the Google Pixel 7 Pro if...  

June Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. eSIM just isn't for you

Technically, you can buy an iPhone 14 Pro from anywhere outside of the US and gain access to a SIM card slot. But there are just as many problems if you go that route, including [potential deficits](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-worst-thing-about-esim-only-iphone-14s/) to your cellular connection. Instead, Google's Pixel 7 Pro, no matter where you buy it, will support the standard physical SIM card and eSIM. That means, for one, frequent travelers won't have to go through the hassle of registering for new eSIM plans when traveling abroad, or settle for no service at all when going to countries that don't permit the digital service. 

### 2\. You also believe that user experience comes first

Google has made it clear that its [Android software experience](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-android-14-preview-launches-for-developers-heres-whats-new/) is all about you, the user. The same can't be said about iOS, which can feel one-dimensional. (To be fair, Apple has gotten [less strict about customization](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-16-just-dropped-here-are-all-the-improvements-you-asked-for/) over the past year.)

**Review: [Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro pack impressive cameras](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-7-pixel-7-pro-review/)** 

With Android 13, the Pixel 7 Pro includes more settings that allow you to tweak and personalize the user experience to your liking. That ranges from themed icons and wallpapers to [accessibility features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-13-is-officially-here-if-you-have-the-right-kind-of-phone-that-is/). There's also a bevy of creative tools, like [Magic Eraser](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-magic-eraser-on-the-google-pixel/), that make professional tasks like photo editing more user-friendly. 

### 3\. You'd like to save $100 or more

There's no beating around the bush on this one. The Pixel 7 Pro, even when it's not part of the [occasional sale](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0BCQWYR2Z%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C2cb9dabf-aabb-428e-8bb6-45ad3afd4cd8%7Cdtp&dtb=1), is $100 less than the [$999 iPhone 14 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and the difference is greater if you're considering the [$1,099 iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). Price shouldn't be the be-all and end-all of this comparison, but it's certainly worth considering if you're cautious about spending.

## You should buy the iPhone 14 Pro if...

June Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. You'd like a "Pro" phone that doesn't feel like a brick

I swear there's a hidden rule somewhere that states that the best smartphones must span at least 6.7 inches diagonally and be an absolute menace to use one-handed. Fortunately, Apple is one of the few manufacturers still offering a Pro handset that doesn't feel like a calculator in the pocket. The iPhone 14 Pro, with its suitable 6.1-inch framework, is pleasant to hold and ever so capable to use. It has the same camera system -- front and back -- as the larger [Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) variant, so you're not settling for second by going small. 

**Review: [iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max bring a lot more innovation for last year's price](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/)**

### 2\. You're a sucker for symmetry

It's just another way for me to say that the [iPhone 14 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) is one of the best-designed [phones of the year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/). From the symmetrical bezels that surround the bright and pixel-full display to the Dynamic Island that is both better-looking and more practical than any notch in iPhone history, the 14 Pro is as good as a modern-day Apple phone gets. 

### 3\. You're ready to sell your soul to Apple -- or already have

It's true: Once you purchase an Apple product, it'll take [a journey for you to escape](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-fall-in-love-with-the-apple-ecosystem-all-over-again-spend-more-money-and-buy-new-stuff/). Loyalty to the brand is justified, though. Apple continues to make good products that deliver on core values -- such as the iPhone, especially for texting and content capture -- and prove the test of time. There's also a seamless integration across its portfolio that enhances the overall experience the more of its products that you use.
