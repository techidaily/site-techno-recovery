The Barnes and Noble Nook is one of the most famous ebook stores in America and many people buy ebooks from it.

 Maybe you have got a lot of Nook books already but you only have a Kindle eReader, then you need to transfer Nook books to Kindle. 

Maybe you own a Nook eReader and now get a new Kindle device, you want to transfer your Nook books to Kindle.

Or you just want to share some fantastic books with your families and friends who have a Kindle device.

No matter what your demands are, converting Nook to Kindle can be helpful. Therefore, in this article I am going to show two ways to transferring Nook books to Kindle.

* [Part 1\. Transfer Nook books to Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Part 2\. Transfer Nook books to Kindle Fire (HD)](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Part 1\. Transfer Nook Books to Kindle eReaders(Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis)

Nook books are usually locked by Nook DRM. You cannot directly transfer Nook books to Kindle because of the DRM limitation. So removing DRM is the first step. Besides, Kindle doesn't support Nook formats, so you also need to convert Nook books to Kindle supported formats before transferring them to Kindle. Now let's figure out how to transfer Nook books to Kindle eReader. 

Step 1 Download Nook books to your Windows computer via Nook app.

Important Updates: The NOOK for Windows App is no longer available for new downloads from the Microsoft Store since 11/29/2023\. If you're not able to download Nook for Windows app, we recommend you use **Epubor Nook Converter to [Remove Nook DRM on Windows/Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).**

If Nook for Windows App is still existing on your PC, you can continue to use the app as usual and download your Nook books to computer via Nook for Windows App.

Launch Nook app, log in with your own Nook account, then click the book covers to download.

![download nook contents](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/nook-contents-download.jpg)

The downloaded nook files are stored in following path: _C:\\Users\\\[Your Username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\BarnesNoble.Nook\_\[several digits\]\\LocalState_.

Step 2 Remove DRM from Nook books by using Epubor Ultimate.

Download[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to your computer(Win).

[_Epubor Ultimate for Windows Free Download_](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

 Install Epubor Ultimate to your Windows and launch it. All your newly downloaded nook contents will be imported automatically and will be listed on the left sidebar. Just drag them to the right interface of the program, DRM will be removed quickly. 

![backup nook 2020](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/backup-nook.png)

If this is the first time that you use Epubor Ultimate to handle Nook books, you may failed to [remove Nook DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Please don't worry. In this case, you need to contact Epubor via [support@epubor.com](http://www.epubor.com/mailto:support@epubor.com) to request the Nook decrypt key file. 

Step 3 Convert DRM free nook epub to Kindle mobi.

The decrypted files will be non-drm ePub. But for kindle reading, we also should [convert the Nook to Kindle format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Select Mobi or AZW3 as output format and click on "Convert" button to start the conversion. 

Step 4 Transfer converted mobi/AZW3 books to Kindle Paperwhite.

Connect your Kindle eReader to computer via USB cable. Double click the Kindle drive, and you will see there is a "Documents" folder. Then drag your converted mobi or azw3 ebooks to the "Documents" folder. Done. Then safely eject your Kindle device from your computer. Start your Kindle, and you will be able to read your nook books on your Kindle Paperwhite.

### Part 2\. Transfer Nook Books to Kindle Fire (HD)

For Kindle Fire (HD) tablet owners, if you have a standard USB cord which can effectively connect your Kindle Fire (HD) to your computer, just plug in your Kindle Fire to computer and transfer the converted Nook books to the device by following the steps in the above method.

But if your USB cable can only be used to charge your Kindle Fire, you can install Nook for Android App on your Kindle Fire (HD). Then download your Nook books to Kindle Fire (HD) directly.

Step 1 Enable your Kindle Fire to run third-party apps.

You are only allowed to install apps from the Amazon app store with Kindle Fire. But you can fix this by setting the tablet. Go to **Settings** \- **More ...-** **Device** \-   **Allow Installation of Applications** **ON**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 2 Install Nook for Android APK to Kindle Fire.

Search for "**Nook for Android APK free download**" on Kindle Fire's built-in browser. Then tap **Downloads**" at the bottom of the webpage, next tap to install. Or you can download "Nook for Android APK" using Google Chrome first, then transfer the downloaded APK file to the "Documents" folder of Kindle Fire (HD) via USB and install it to your Kindle Fire (HD). 

Step 3  Read nook books via Nook app on Fire.

 Sign in with your Nook account. Then you can sync your Nook books to your Kindle Fire (HD).

It may not be so easy to get it done successfully using this method with one shot, especially for non-tech-savvy users. If you don't want to install Nook for Android app on your tablet or you feel it's too complicated to operate, you can remove Nook DRM and convert them to Kindle formats, then transfer your DRM free Nook books to your Kindle Fire.

Hi,

 The first time you launch Nook app, it will let you enter your Nook account and password to sign in.

 After you log in it successfully, you can simply click the cover to download your Nook books.

In Epubor Ultimate I can see books in left hand side under Adobe, as epub File but when I drag it to the right, it says "DRM is removing, please make sure you can read the ebook on your computer at first". This remains at 0% and does not progress, and they do not appear in the right hand side.

I am having a problem transferring my Nook e-books to kindle. The instructions that are given for # 3 "Transfer converted Mobi books to kindle e readers" is not working. I have a new kindle fire but used this instruction for transferring my e-books. For # 2- "Transfer Nook books to kindle Fire (HD)" instructions, there isn't a Select More... " Device setting on my kindle fire (HD). These instructions are not helpful to me. Additionally, when I had to buy the Epubor Ultimate software to transfer my books my library is large and only 436 e-books transferred. I originally have 554 e-books, so what happened to the rest of my e-books during the transfer? None of these instructions help me. If anyone can give me some assistance, I appreciate it! Otherwise, I am returning my kindle even though I had to buy Epubor Ultimate.

The best way to download nook books via Nook for windows and then copy it to your Mac computer to remove the Nook DRM.
