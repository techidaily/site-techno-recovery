**What is Audible AAX format?** The file with the AAX extension is a data file format associated with [Audible's enhanced format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). AAX is an exclusive audiobook format developed by Audible.com, and the AAX file is a multimedia digital audiobook that includes images, links, videos, and a timeline. The AAX format can be considered an enhanced version of the older AA audiobook format developed by Audible. Compared to AA, the AAX format has a higher bit rate of 64Kbps and takes up more space. Consequently, the AAX format offers higher sound quality due to its 'uncompressed' feature. In 2020, Audible.com discontinued the AA format, transitioning exclusively to the Audible AAX format. As a result, it is no longer possible to download audiobooks in the AA format.

Here, I will guide you on how to convert AAX to MP3 on Windows 10/11\. This method is also applicable to other Windows systems such as Windows 8 and 7\.

The files are converted to M4B format. You then have to click on Convert to MP3\. Do not lose patience, on my PC, it can take up to an hour to convert a single file! Why does it take so long?   
 Why cannot we have a choice that goes straight to MP3?

Thank you for using Epubor audible converter. When you drag the aax file to audible converter, the file will be decrypted at once. The m4b is the decrypted file because aax actually is the m4b file with some DRM protection. That's why you need the step "Convert to mp3". I am sincerely sorry for the conversion speed but the conversion is a time consuming process.   
 Here is a tip: If you want to get mp3 directly, you can download audible file as format4(.aa). In this situation, when you drag the aa file to audible converter, it will be decrypted in mp3 directly. You do not have to convert it any more.
