I used the free trial today to convert my epub books to mobi, all was working well. It worked for about another 80 books but now just keeps coming up with a 'failed' message beside the book whenever I try to convert the format.

Good E-Reader said that (in their blog) they launches a 13.3 inch device, really? Will it supports Kindle formats? How to buy books? I really want to buy a bigger e-Reader for Manga reading.

I sync my Kindle files via Kindle app and get some "fragment files" not azw format. Epubor Kindle DRM removal cannot recognize it. Is this the new format of Kindle files? I just want to decrypt some Kindle files. 

[No longer supporting this?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/4/2016 5:53:38 AM 

I bought a lifetime license. I have had several reformats of my system and need a new unlock code. And this probably won't be the last time  
 I am getting ZERO response from tech support. Chats aren't answered, Tickets don't have numbers, emails are never answered.  
 I payed ahead in good faith and would like that good faith to be respected  
 Thanks

From Jan 3rd this year only available to download in KFX format which will not be available for older versions of Kindle for PC.  
 Do you have any plans to enable Epubor ultimate to handle the new format.  
 All the best

[Free trial needs paid license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/8/2021 3:29:22 AM 

Hello. I just downloaded a free trial for Mac and tested on a Kindle book. It opens with the message: "Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format."

 Can I register without first paying?  
 If I like the software I would buy the Lifetime License but want to be sure first.  
 Thank you.

A few weeks ago a purchased your Audible converter. I understand from Audible that they are changing their download format on 30 June. We I be able to use the program to convert their new format to MP3.

 Many thanks

[aaxc file format. Will it be supported?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 8/5/2022 12:39:59 PM 

Hi, do you have plans to support the aaxc format? Z3kit does it in a long awkward fashion but I like the ease of your software. Traditionally I would download to PC but now titles are being streamed from the cloud and you can not download these to PC, only to android or IPhone. Android is aaxc format.

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??
