## How to Transfer Your Downloads: Syncing Ebooks to an iPad via MacOS X Mavericks

## Sync Downloaded Books to iPad in Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks

Apple surprisingly makes the Mac OS X Mavericks upgrade free to all the Mac users, which makes Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks the most "popular" version ever, for the activation speed is faster than any previous version.

The new Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks brings many exciting new features, of which the most attractive one to me is the independent iBooks application. With it we can finally read iBooks on Mac computers. But it is the iBooks application that makes many people want to downgrade to Mac OS X 10.8.5, saying the iBooks application is totally a mess.

### iTunes can't sync/transfer local downloaded EPUB books to iPad under Mavericks

In the past we need to use iTunes to sync any kind of contents or apps to our iPad, iPhone or iPod. With Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks making iBooks an independent application, the "Books" is gone from iTunes library. When you open iTunes under the Mac 10.9 Mavericks and go to "Books", a notification tells you the "Books" have moved away.

![iBooks have moved in mac os x 10.9 mavericks](http://www.epubor.com/images/iBooks-have-moved.png)

And when you want to drag a downloaded local EPUB or PDF books into iTunes, it just bounces back and nothing changes. What's worse, you cannot find a sync button on the new iBooks for Mac application, either. In another word, we are unable to sync downloaded local EPUB and PDF books to our iPad, or other iOS devices.

### iTunes says no, we make it yes

I am not saying cracking iTunes or iBooks for Mac. To transfer or sync downloaded local EPUB and PDF eBooks to iPad, we have many other choices, and here I will introduce the most capable and simplest way - **Calibre Content Server**.

To use this method for syncing local eBooks to iPad, we need to meet these requirements:

1\. Calibre for Mac is installed;

2\. iPad and Mac computer connected to the same local are network.

That's all. And below is the step-by-step guide.

1Install Calibre on your Mac

Calibre is totally free to download and use. Click the buttons below you can download the Mac version directly.

[![calibre for mac](http://www.epubor.com/images/guide-download-mac.png)](http://status.calibre-ebook.com/dist/osx32)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2Load the books you want to sync into Calibre

By directly dragging eBook files into Calibre you can load them in.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3Enable Calibre Content Server feature

Look at the menu bar at the top, click "Connect/share --> Start Content Server". Then the three blue ball will turn to green, and there will display your IP address and port information, which will be necessary in the following steps.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4Visit Calibre Content Server on your iPad

Now take your iPad and open the web browser, input \[your IP address:port\] in the url address bar and visit it. For example, my IP address is 192.168.1.16 and my port is 8080, then I should visit 192.168.1.16:8080.

5Sync/Transfer books to iPad under Mavericks

Click the "Get" button under book cover, then we will be navigated to a page which asks you how to open this file. "Open in 'iBooks'" is what we choose.

![how-to-open-ibooks](http://www.epubor.com/images/how-to-open-ibooks.png)

After pressing "Open in 'iBooks'", the iBooks for iPad app will pop out automatically, and you will be able to see this book displayed on the shelf.

Now this downloaded local book has already been synced to iPad, even we are using Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks.

Another truth is...Dropbox is not that popular in many non-US countries, and, you also need a dropbox app on iPad.

Dropbox would have been easy but it would not provide/allow(???) DRM removed ebooks for the iPad, and I tried several times. The beauty of Jonny's directions is they work with DRM removed books. Please note that the local librarian is OK with DRM removal since I can "return" the books as quickly as their system allows. She wishes the publishers would work with libraries better than they do.

This works great, however, it does not sync your iPad books with the iBooks app on your Mac. This only doves half of the problem.  
 By the way, this technique is widely know and not a new idea. I've been doing this for several years already.

Works like a charm...I always wondered what that content server was and how it worked. Thank you for the detailed instructions. Now that Apple as 'unhooked' iBooks from iTunes this is a great alternative as I like iBooks on iPad/iPhone.

Thank you for this simple and elegant solution. I tried it on my iPhone and it synced with my iPad. As mentioned by others, Dropbox is another solution but you have to consider having to transfer your books out of Calibre into Dropbox. I prefer to keep my Dropbox available for other uses.

Jonny, this is all quite unnecessary... of course you can sync downloaded local (non-apple) books, you just drop them into iBooks on the Mac.

 Then connect your iPad/iPhone to iTunes via USB or WiFi, select it, and look in the "Books" tab. There you will see all the books in your iBooks library, and you can check off "Sync books", and choose all books or only selected ones. Do a sync, and you're done!

 If you have iCloud set up, it will even sync reading position, bookmarks, highlights, and notes, for your epubs, even non-apple ones, to your Mac. Try that with Kindle, Sony, or any other product... Apple is the only one who got it right!

Or just drag to iBooks. This adds it to the iBooks library. The next time your iPad/iPhone syncs with iTunes the recently added book gets synchronized. No need for 3rd party apps.
