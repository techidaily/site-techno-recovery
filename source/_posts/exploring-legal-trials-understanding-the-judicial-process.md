The website says that there is a 30 day free trial, but the program asks for a registration code. How can I try before buying?

[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

[eBook conversion failed](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/18/2016 3:06:12 AM 

I used the free trial today to convert my epub books to mobi, all was working well. It worked for about another 80 books but now just keeps coming up with a 'failed' message beside the book whenever I try to convert the format.

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[Removing DRM hangs?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/13/2016 9:19:10 AM 

I am trying the Epubor Ultimate 30 day trial with the latest Kobo Desktop app on Windows 10\. It shows the list of the Kobo books but I can't drag a book from the right to the main window. I can double-click the book but then I get a window that states 'DRM is removing, please make sure you can read the ebook on your computer at first'. This window never closes. I can read the book through the Kobo app. What am I doing wrong?

[Can I get a registration code # for my converter software?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/22/2019 6:50:26 AM 

Can I get a registration code # for my converter software so it will work everytime I open it, even offline? Currently, I have to connect to the internet and input my email address for the program to convert the entire file. Otherwise, all it does is convert 3 minutes, as a trial version.

[Nook is not listed in left panel of Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 5/4/2019 2:44:54 AM 

Hi I'm using your trial version of Ultimate. A Nook option is not in the vendor list on the left panel. (Yes, I clicked the ellipses button, not there either).  
 I'm on a Windows 10 Desktop computer.   
 As you probably know, Nook for PC no longer works. So I've deleted the program, however the downloads directory (containing books) is still on the computer. Folder: D:\\Documents\\My Barnes & Noble   
 Most if not all of these book are key encrypted with the old B&N method of user name + credit card #.

[Free trial needs paid license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/8/2021 3:29:22 AM 

Hello. I just downloaded a free trial for Mac and tested on a Kindle book. It opens with the message: "Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format."

 Can I register without first paying?  
 If I like the software I would buy the Lifetime License but want to be sure first.  
 Thank you.

[Limits on trial version of Epubor Ultimate?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 2/5/2021 10:55:46 AM 

You offer a 30-day free trial of Epubor Ultimate. What limits are there on the use of the trial version? (I want to test conversion of up to 5 AZW3 files that are locked by DRM before comitting to purchase).

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
).

[Licence key](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/23/2021 6:36:48 AM 

Hi,

 I want to avail the free 30 day trail for Epubor before I buy the full version. However, upon installing the software, it is asking for a licence key for me to be able to try it. Where can I find that for a trial version?

 Thanks

[Free trial limit the number of page to convert to 40?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/25/2020 3:47:15 AM 

Hi,

 I just wanted to try your converter for an ebook I uploaded from Amazon via Kindle for PC (Version 1.24 as you were suggesting).  
 It worked but only for 40 pages, despite the fact the book as many more pages (that I can access on Kindle in the Cloud)!  
 My question: Is it a normal limitation or is there a problem Or I did somethgn wrong? 

 Best regards
