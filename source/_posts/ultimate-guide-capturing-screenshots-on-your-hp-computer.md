## Use the Keyboard to Take a Screenshot in Windows

 There are a few ways to take screenshots using the keyboard. Most methods require you to paste and save the screen capture in the image editor of your choice.

### Save the Screen to the Clipboard

 Use the**PrtSc** (Print Screen) button to capture everything visible on the screen to the clipboard. It's often on the far right of the top row of the keyboard. You will then need to paste the image into an editor like Paint (or some[other image editor](https://www.lifewire.com/free-photo-editors-1357098) ) to see and manipulate the image further.

 To use the screenshot in a document, place the cursor where you want the image to be, and then press**Ctrl** +**V** to paste.

### Capture the Whole Screen

 Press**Win** +**PrtSc** to capture the whole screen. You'll see a flash on the screen for just a moment to indicate that the screenshot was taken. By default, this kind of screen capture goes directly into this folder:

 `C:\Users\[username]\Pictures\Screenshots`

 On some keyboards, you must hold down the**FN** key as well, so the whole shortcut is**Win** +**Fn** +**PrtSc** .

### Capture Part of the Screen

 Simultaneously press**Win** +**Shift** +**S** . Drag your cursor over the area of the screen you want to capture. The selected section will be saved to the clipboard and also stored in the**Pictures\\Screenshots** folder.  

### Capture the Active Window

 Use**Alt** +**PrtSc** to capture the active window and add it to the clipboard. You will see no indication that the capture actually happened.

## How to Take a Screenshot With Snipping Tool

 The Windows Snipping Tool offers advanced options for capturing and editing screenshots. With it, you can take a screenshot of the laptop's whole screen at once, or just one window, or a specific part of the screen.

1. Open the**Start menu** , search for**Snipping Tool** , and select the app to open it.
