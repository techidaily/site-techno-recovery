## Are You Receiving the Real Deal with Dolby Atmos Technology?
 When we buy a TV, we want to be sure we're getting what we paid for.

## How to Test for Dolby Atmos Sound

 Testing for Dolby Atmos can be a bit difficult as supported media will automatically upmix to[7.1 or 5.1 surround](https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-channels-3135062) when a Dolby Atmos setup isn’t detected. Upmixing can give the impression of Atmos working when it isn’t, as it will still output a degree of surround sound through the various speakers.

![Illustration of a Dolby Atmos speaker setup.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UnPfGTj0qEas7YZiXWTJT8jH5j4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/are-you-really-getting-dolby-atmos-sound-02-4abca410a28e4ac3a72ff4cb2de9d951.jpg)

Dolby

 Here are the best ways to test if you're getting Dolby Atmos.

* **Play a Dolby Atmos movie or video** . Throw on a video or movie that you know supports Dolby Atmos, and choose a scene with many objects flying around. Atmos is working if you can detect individual items moving around independently of the main channels.[Dolby has several YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4e6%5FQLepbRHjN8fVLKvwaiXbOBhmQtA) that you can use for such tests.
* **Check your TV display** . Most TVs will display what audio output it's using when something is playing. Press the**Audio** ,**Info** , or**Menu** button on your TV remote to bring this text up. Look for a reference to**Atmos** or**Dolby** **Atmos** .
* **Check your AV receiver** . If you're using an AV receiver, look at its display to see what audio it's detecting.
* **Does your speaker have an app?** Some soundbars and speaker systems can connect to an app to manage levels and settings. These apps can often display the audio type they're processing, such as Dolby Atmos.

## What Is Dolby Atmos, Anyway?

 Dolby Atmos is a form of surround sound technology that uses object-based audio to create the illusion of individual items moving around a 3D space.

 For example, an action scene with Dolby Atmos audio could project audio from the front, rear, and side speakers as usual while also focusing on sound associated with a missile as it moves from one location to the next.

 The Dolby Atmos sound technology can automatically upmix audio data to work with existing 5.1 and 7.1 home theater setups, a single soundbar setup, and headphones.

## How Do I Get Dolby Atmos on My TV?

 To get Dolby Atmos working at home, you'll need some combination of the following:

* **A media source that supports Dolby Atmos** . It can be a streaming app, a video game, or a physical[4K Blu-ray disk that supports Dolby Atmos](https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-atmos-blu-ray-disc-releases-1847052) .
* **A device that can process Dolby Atmos** . If you're watching Dolby Atmos content via an app, the device running the app will need to support Dolby Atmos. The same goes for a Blu-ray player and video game console.
* **A Dolby Atmos compatible sound system** . It could be a Dolby Atmos soundbar or a full Dolby Atmos speaker setup capable of processing the Atmos sound data.
* **A compatible AV receiver** . Depending on your setup, you may not need an AV receiver but, if you are, it will need to support Dolby Atmos.

 It's important to emphasize that you don't need all of the above to experience Dolby Atmos. If your smart TV supports Dolby Atmos and you're streaming Dolby Atmos media directly from it via an app that supports Dolby Atmos, and you're not using any additional speakers, that's completely fine.

 However, once you start using multiple devices, you'll need to ensure that each piece of hardware and software you're using is Atmos compatible. For example, even if your speaker setup, AV receiver, and 4K Blu-ray disk support Dolby Atmos, you still won't get Atmos audio if the 4K Blu-ray player is limited to a basic 5.1 audio output.

## Which TVs Have Dolby Atmos?

 A growing number of manufacturers produce TVs that support Dolby Atmos audio. Some more well-known brands adding Dolby Atmos functionality include LG, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, and Visio.

 Not all TV models support Dolby Atmos so it’s important to check before making a new purchase.

 Given that Dolby Atmos is a popular feature, support for the technology is often mentioned prominently within a TV’s product description online and in stores. A list of Dolby Atmos TV models is available on the[official Dolby website](https://www.dolby.com/experience/) though this isn’t an exhaustive list.

## What Xbox Consoles Support Dolby Atmos?

 The third and fourth generations of Xbox video game consoles support Dolby Atmos sound, which includes the following:

* **Xbox One**
* **Xbox One S**
* **Xbox One X**
* **Xbox Series S**
* **Xbox Series X**

## Does Sony’s PlayStation 5 Support Dolby Atmos?

 PlayStation 5 consoles don’t support Dolby Atmos, but they use Sony’s own[Tempest 3D AudioTech 3D audio technology](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/#3daudio) . Tempest 3D AudioTech works in much the same way as Dolby Atmos by allowing individual audio elements to move around a three-dimensional space.

## Does the Nintendo Switch Support Dolby Atmos?

 The Nintendo Switch only supports a basic 5.1 audio output, which it's limited to when it’s docked and connected to your TV.

 If you have a Dolby Atmos setup and want to play a Nintendo Switch game with these enhancements, you will need to check if the game's available on Xbox or PC and play that version instead.

## Does Dolby Atmos Really Make a Difference?

 Dolby Atmos can significantly enhance a viewing or listening experience, but the level of improvement will depend on the theater setup and the media.

 For example, those with a multi-speaker setup playing a blockbuster action movie will likely notice a vastly improved experience that could even rival going to the cinema with greater clarity between sound elements and a truly three-dimensional audio space.

 If you’re watching something on a Dolby Atmos-enabled TV with no additional speakers, though, the improvement will be less stark.

## Does Dolby Atmos Make Music Sound Better?

 Dolby Atmos enhances music quite a bit as it clarifies individual audio elements of performances through its object-based technology and creates the illusion of music being performed in a 3D space.

 The quality of your listening experience depends on your audio setup, though.

 While traditional music playback can sound relatively flat, even with multiple audio channels, Dolby Atmos' music feels more like being in a room with a live performance.

[Apple Music added support for Dolby Atmos in early-2021](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-music-to-provide-lossless-and-spatial-audio-support-5185036) , and other music services will likely follow suit in the future. A[growing number of podcasts are also experimenting with 3D sound and Atmos](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273072/podcast-audio-3d-dolby-atmos-iheart-qcode) .

## Do You Really Need Dolby Atmos?

 Like how 4K visual content automatically rescales to match older TVs and monitors, all Dolby Atmos audio products downscale to work on 7.1, 5.1, stereo, and even mono sound setups when Dolby Atmos support isn’t detected. For example, a movie on[Disney Plus](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-on-disney-4687015) may have Dolby Atmos sound, but you can still watch it in stereo or 5.1 surround if that’s all your setup can handle. You’ll still hear all of the movie’s audio, just without the Atmos 3D immersion.

 Dolby Atmos audio automatically converts to another compatible audio output format when a Dolby Atmos hardware or setup isn't detected.

 No one technically needs Dolby Atmos sound, but it is undeniably a fantastic extra tool for those after a more immersive viewing, listening, or gaming experience while at home.

## How Are Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos Different?

 Dolby Atmos is an advanced audio technology, while[Dolby Vision is an HDR format for image processing](https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427) . Similar to how Atmos focuses on individual sounds, Vision focuses on individual frames or scenes to provide a more nuanced presentation.

![Example of Dolby Vision image clarity with a photo of an ice cave.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9FOlcT9kfv8TEHxWYjbi9fEyhrA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/are-you-really-getting-dolby-atmos-sound-03-82704b2437444a9ab16d61f4b1b9039c.jpg)

Dolby

 Support for Dolby Vision doesn’t necessarily mean that Atmos is also supported and vice versa. However, the two technologies are often paired together. When they are, they’re still listed as separate features on a product’s promotional materials or in its manual.
