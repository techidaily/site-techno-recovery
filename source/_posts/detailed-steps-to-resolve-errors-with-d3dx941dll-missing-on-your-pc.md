## How to Fix D3dx9\_24.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented to address the simpler solutions first.

 Do not, under any circumstances, download d3dx9\_24.dll individually from any "DLL download site." There are a number of reasons that[downloading DLLs from these sites are never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, remove it from wherever you put it and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet done so.  
 The d3dx9\_24.dll error might be a fluke or one-time issue and a simple restart could clear it up completely. It's unlikely this will fix the problem, but restarting is always a good first troubleshooting step.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the d3dx9\_24.dll not found error.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the d3dx9\_24.dll error you're receiving, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or other program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something may have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_24.dll and a reinstall could do the trick.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_24.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above standard troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your d3dx9\_24.dll error, try extracting the d3dx9\_24.dll file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations, updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.  
 The same DirectX installation program works with all[versions of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/what-version-of-windows-do-i-have-2624927) and will replace any missing DirectX file.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.

## Causes D3dx9\_24.dll Errors

 Unlike many other[DLL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) errors which can have complicated causes and fixes, d3dx9\_24.dll issues are caused in one way or another by a single thing: some kind of problem with Microsoft DirectX.

 The d3dx9\_24.dll file is one of many files contained in DirectX. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows based games and advanced graphics programs, d3dx9\_24.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

 There are a number of ways d3dx9\_24.dll errors may show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common error messages:

* **D3DX9\_24.DLL Not Found**
* **File d3dx9\_24.dll not found**
* **The file d3dx9\_24.dll is missing**
* **D3DX9\_24.DLL is missing. Replace D3DX9\_24.DLL and try again.**
* **D3dx9\_24.dll not found. Reinstalling might help fix this.**
* **This application has failed to start because d3dx9\_24.dll could not be found!**
