## When Will the Next Samsung Unpacked Take Place?

 We don't have details for the next Samsung Unpacked event, but we think it will be in January 2025\. It will likely focus on the company's flagship Galaxy phones.

 The previous Unpacked was on July 10, 2024; the company announced the latest Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold models, along with Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Watches, and the new Galaxy Ring.

## How to Watch Samsung Unpacked

 Samsung's events happen around the world, but the company streams it live on its website and YouTube channels. You can learn how to[watch it here](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-samsung-unpacked-online-5095263) .

## Which Products Will Be Released?

 The last January event featured the latest versions of Samsung's flagship Galaxy S phones, so we expect the same for 2025\. We'll see the[Galaxy S25/S25+](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-8636730) and[S25 Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-8639667) for sure. We might also see a new Galaxy Tablet, but we'll have to wait and see.

## What Previous Unpacked Events Announced

 Curious about what Samsung's announced at the last event? We've got the details below. The Galaxy Flip and Fold series are the[newest phones from the tech giant](https://www.lifewire.com/newest-samsung-galaxy-phone-7567396) .

### July 2024 Unpacked Event

 The following products were announced at the July 2024 Unpacked event.

* [Galaxy Ring](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-8431146)
* [Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-8607182)
* Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro
* [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-8621840)
* [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-z-fold-6-8418354)

 The Galaxy Ring is a brand-new device for Samsung. They mean you to wear it all day, and it focuses particularly on sleep tracking. It has three sensors: an accelerometer, a photo-based cell to read heart rate, and one that measures your skin temperature.

 The big change for the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the programmable Fast Button, which you can use to quickly start a workout or do other tasks. Both watches include gesture controls that let you do things like turn off phone alarms or take pictures with a double-tap of your fingers.

 The Galaxy Buds come in two types. The main difference is that the regular Galaxy Buds 3 are an open type (the buds sit against your ear canal), while the Buds 3 are canal-type (the buds fit inside your ear canal). Both versions have dynamic equalization and noise-canceling, along with 24-bit audio, but only the Buds 3 Pro have a two-way speaker.

 The foldable devices–the Flip 6 and Fold 6–continue the company's dedication to artificial intelligence with new photo editing and generation features. One notable one has your phone generating a fully rendered image based on your sketch.
