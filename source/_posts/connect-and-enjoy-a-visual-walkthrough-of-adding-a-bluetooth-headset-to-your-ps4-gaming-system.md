 If you’d like to connect**bluetooth headphones to PS4** , don’t worry. Here are**4 ways**  for you to try. Just choose an easier way and follow the**instructions** step by step to**pair** your bluetooth headphones.

1. [**Connect to the PS4 with the supported Bluetooth devices**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Connect the Bluetooth headset wired to the PS4**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

4. [**Connect the Bluetooth headset to the PS4 by a Dongle**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## **Why Bluetooth audio devices is not supported by PS4?**

 After the PlayStation 4 has launched, Sony has announced that**PS4 doesn’t support A2DP** (that includes Bluetooth devices)**or any audio streaming** **Bluetooth**   **profile** . A2DP stands for**Advance Audio Distribution Profile** , which is stereo music sent over**Bluetooth** wirelessly.

 Why Sony stops supporting Bluetooth devices for PS4? The reason is that**A2DP will be lagged around 100-200ms** , and that would make things feel weird when you are using those devices, so you can’t pair most of the Bluetooth devices to PS4\. But**there is a workaround for that** . Try the ways below to connect Bluetooth devices to your PS4 and enjoy your games!

## **Way 1: Connect to the PS4 with the supported Bluetooth devices**

 If your Bluetooth device is supported by Sony, you can directly configure the settings to make it paired. If you are not sure whether it’s supported by Sony, you can check the headset package to find out the information. But it’s never harmful to try to set up the settings.

 1) Turn on your**Bluetooth headset** in**pair mode** to connect.

 2) Go to PS4**Settings** \>**Devices** \>**Bluetooth** **Devices** .

 3) Select the**name of your headset** to connect.

 4) If it connects successfully, you can try to play games now with your Bluetooth headset.

 If unfortunately, it fails, and you see a message like:**Bluetooth audio devices are not supported by the PS4** , or**Cannot connect to the Bluetooth device within the time limit** , you can try the following ways.

## **Way 2: Connect the Bluetooth headset wired to the PS4**

 As Sony stops supporting most Bluetooth devices for PS4, you may need**an extra tool** to help connect your Bluetooth headset with your PS4\. In this method, you need**an audio cable with a built-in microphone** . Most Bluetooth headsets have that cable, for example, you can some Bluetooth headsets like **[this headset for PS4 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Avantree-Headphones-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Simultaneously/dp/B0793NV5GL/ref=sr%5F1%5F6?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1540967519&sr=1-6&keywords=bluetooth+headset+for+ps4&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  (with reasonable price and good reviews) Then follow these steps:

 1)**Connect** your Bluetooth headset and your PS4 controller with the audio cable with built-in mic. Then**turn on your** **headset** .

 2) Go to PS4**Settings** \>**Devices** \>**Bluetooth** **Devices** .

## **Way 3: Connect the Bluetooth headset to the PS4 by a USB adapter**

For example, I use this **[USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Avantree-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Nintendo-Headphones/dp/B01G3J1I5M/ref=sr%5F1%5F8?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1540967773&sr=1-8&keywords=usb+adapter+for+ps4&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  to connect my PS4 with the Bluetooth headset.

## **Way 4: Connect the Bluetooth headset to the PS4 by a Dongle**

 You can connect your Bluetooth headset with your PS4 very quickly and easily with this method. You just need a**Dongle** and a**wireless microphone** to receive the Bluetooth signal.

For example, **[this Dongle on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Avantree-Bluetooth-Nintendo-Driver-Free-Transmitter/dp/B01G3J1I5M/?tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  is also paired with a wireless microphone, and it’s cheap to buy.

 1) Insert the**wireless mic** into the**PS4 controller** .
