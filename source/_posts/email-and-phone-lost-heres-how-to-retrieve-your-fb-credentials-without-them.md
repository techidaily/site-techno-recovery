## Email and Phone Lost? Here's How to Retrieve Your FB Credentials Without Them

Close 

###  What to Know

* To log in when you've forgotten your password, select your profile from the**Recent Logins** section on Facebook.com.
* Another way is to open the[ Find Your Account](https://www.facebook.com/login/identify) form and search for your name.
* If you're using the mobile app, tap**Forgot password?** to see your reset options.

 This article explains what to do if you forget the password to your Facebook account. The instructions apply to desktop and mobile users.

##  How to Reset a Facebook Password on a Desktop 

 If you're logged out of Facebook and forgot your password, you can reset it in a few steps (most of the time). Here are your options:

1. If you're on a device that was recently logged in to your Facebook account, Facebook may be able to save the day by presenting you with**Recent Logins** on Facebook.com.  
 If you see your profile, select it to log in automatically. You do not need to know or have access to your phone or email to do this.  
![The Recent Logins box on the Facebook website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jKziL6y4zSeALDb9KEzGfAOgXuU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/facebook-recent-logins-bb0d9b3fce79486d9f04545eef100a27.png)  
 This only works if you checked the box to save your password the last time you logged in.
2. If you're on a new device or Facebook doesn't remember your last login, select**Forgot password?** to open the Find Your Account page.
3. Enter your name or the username associated with your account, then select**Search** .

 If you_do_ have access to your email account, enter it here. Then, select**Try another way** to see the option to reset your FB password with a code sent to your email account.
4. Facebook will show you matching search results. Select**This Is My Account** if you see your profile picture.  
![A list of Facebook profiles with This Is My Account buttons](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zYXu2H-Jyf-SWvyWAY_JirbjyHc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/facebook-reset-your-password-217cc36f47654a799cbb1c976edaa959.png)  
 Don't see it? Select**I am not in this list** and then enter the name of a Facebook friend to help locate your account.
5. If you recognize the partial phone number or email shown on the screen, select that option and then choose**Continue** .  
![The Send code via SMS option selected on Facebook's Reset your password form](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DM1_OORPxdPHqWGUb7p2IMfW7iY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/facebook-reset-password-sms-c45f99b6211a4ac5a302907468a9a3ba.png)  
 If you found your account but no longer have access to the phone number or email that's tied to your account, Facebook can't verify your identity.
6. If you found your account and selected a method for receiving your reset code, enter the security code you received and select**Continue** to follow the remaining on-screen steps.
