It's no doubt that Amazon's Kindle eReader is the most popular reading devices among this industry, especially after Amazon introduced their new device, Kindle Voyage. ![convert drm epub to kindle mac](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-drm-epub-to-kindle-mac.jpg)It's said that this reader is as slim as a piece of paper, and features a new adaptive front light sensor. Though prices at $199, higher than any generations of kindle, there are still a large number of people pre-order it, me too (so funny, why not?).

But there is a fatal problem we can't avoid. Kindle doesn't support the the ePub! This means, if we want to read epub files on Kindle, we should convert epub to kindle format. About how to, I have written a guide [convert drm protected epub to kindle format mobi](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) (nearly all of the epub are with drm). For those mac users, it may be a little difficult to convert epub files if the computer operation system is Mac, so today I decide to write this content **how to convert drm epub to kindle mac easily**.

### First of all, make sure you can open epub on Mac

To convert epub to kindle mac successfully, we should make sure that we can open these epub files on mac. 

EPUB books we purchased from Google Books, Rakuten Kobo, Nook book store, or other online collections, often they are with Adobe DRM. And the Adobe Digital Editions is the only one specified application that could open adobe books, so please install [ADE](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) on Mac.

Then authorize your Adobe ID with your computer, open epub with ADE. If you can open them, the next step will be ok. After epub opened, they are saved to your mac in folder "Digital Editions".

Before start, I recommend you a useful tool which will be used later. [**Epubor Ultimate**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), helps you remove drm and convert epub to kindle format. It is the best epub to kindle converter mac.
