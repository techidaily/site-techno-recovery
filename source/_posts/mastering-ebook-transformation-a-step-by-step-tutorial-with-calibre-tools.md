<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Step 3: Add your ebooks to library**. 

You can either drag and drop the books to the Calibre main interface or click "Add books" and then navigate to the folder stored your ebooks to add ebooks to Calibre. When you add a new book, it will appear at the top of the list of books.

### **Step 4: Select ebook on center menu list, click "convert books" to process converting**.

A ebook converting window will pop, choose your **_Output format_** and set the output books, it's easy and user-friendly.

The output is list all the book types, like ePUB,FBZ,HTMLZ,LIT,LRF,MOBI,PDB,PDF,TEXT etc

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After configuring the conversion settings, click 'OK' to start the conversion process. The pop-up window will close and the conversion process will begin.

If you're not paying close attention, you may not notice any immediate changes to the main window, and may be unsure when the conversion process will be finished.

To monitor the progress of the conversion, look at the bottom-right corner of the screen. You will see a '**Jobs: 1**' status, which indicates that the conversion job is in progress."

![Calibre](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_converter-status.jpg "calibre")

When the conversion process is complete, the status will change to '**Jobs: 0**'.

You may notice that there is now a section labeled '**Formats: EPUB, PDF**'. These are the different file types for the converted book.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 5: To locate the converted files, click '**Click to open**'. This will open the folder where the converted files are saved."

![Calibre out formats](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_books-type.jpg "calibre out formats")

Note:

![](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_convert_kindle_to_pdf_-_7.png)

If the the above notification pops up during the conversion, it means that book will be DRM protected. In this case, you will have to install [calibre DRM removal plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to strip DRM from the books. And then add those drm free books to calibre again to convert formats. 

If you want drm-removing much easier, here I highly recommend a powerful calibre alternative -- [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)\-- all-in-one tool that combines drm removal with formats converter.

still one of the worst converters, but highly praised. The results archived mostly differ that much compared to the originals, I always wonder what crap poeple nowadays. If a converter can't keep the textflow on mixed pages (single / multicolumn) which each second best worldprocesser is able to, the best thing to do is to better not mention it, since poeple get disappointed reading books forward beackward each 3 or 4 pages. And Calibre is one of the poorest ones if it comes to this discipline ... still.

Hi, Nagraj

 Does calibre show anything like "DRM protected" or other info?

 If that PDB is purchased from eReader, it is likely to be DRM protected, which will have to be DRM stripped before the conversion.

Hello I converted files from pdf to mobi but they look weird on my kindle, the line ends in the middle of the screen, the spacing is alright two lines in a row and then there's a huge space beneath them. It's very uncomfortable to read this way, is there any optimal setting which I could use that would make the text appear as if on a page in a regular book?

Calibre is an amazing piece of software, it is a powerful conversion tool that allows you complete control over the output of your book. That being said, I understand that some people may have trouble getting started with all the options in the conversion process. I suggest you check out the wealth of "How to's" and "Tips and Tricks" online. Calibre's site has a downloadable manual along with online step by step instructions, another site to check out is the MobileRead Forums. I was overwhelmed myself at first, however, I can assure you that if you put some time into learning the program you will come to appreciate how much it really kicks Arse! Btw, pdf's are really difficult to convert correctly because the are basically an image file.

One must remember that Calibre is like a Swiss army knife. It's for this reason that it gets the praise it receives. Yes, it does a great job of converting HTML/CSS to a number of other formats. The sky is the limit when there is some understanding of those two presentation languages. Yet another downside to conversions is that when handling PDF's just about any other software, short of the uber expensive Acrobat, falls short of formatting & converting the Post script. Recent years Adobe has created an even deeper chasm due to the features it has added to the proprietary source code.

Hi,  
 Me and my friend are working on a little project, Converter central, a tool for converting many different things such as units and clothes. We have recently been considering to add a similar feature as you are describing for converting PDFs and other eBook formats, but in a much more lightweight version with only the most basic options. I wanted to ask you in person, which formats do you feel are the most relevant to convert between? And is there any particular option you think is more useful? I respect totally if you don't have time to give any feedback, and that's fine, but if you do I'd love to hear your thoughts :)

Calibre is currently best SW for eBook conversion and management, but it is not for everyone and some advanced knowledge of eBook formats structure is needed.  
 If you can't get expected result than it is not SW for you - you have to dive deep into settings to get better result, and i fixed some pretty messed up PDFs. In most cases bad result means that the source is s\*\*\*, not that SW is bad.
