Close 

 Whether you run a popular food blog, or if you handle the social media posts for the company you work for,[ Pinterest](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-pinterest-3486578) is one social network that can make a big difference in your traffic, sales, opt-ins, and more. 

 Pinterest itself doesn't allow you to schedule pins (Pinterest posts) to be posted at a particular time, but there are many[ third-party tools](https://www.lifewire.com/social-media-apps-for-managing-everything-3486302) that do allow you to schedule pins.
