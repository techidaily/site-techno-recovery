* Built-in rating system.
* Decent selection of free movies to watch.

 What We Don't Like

* Available only in the US, Canada, and Europe.

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content.
