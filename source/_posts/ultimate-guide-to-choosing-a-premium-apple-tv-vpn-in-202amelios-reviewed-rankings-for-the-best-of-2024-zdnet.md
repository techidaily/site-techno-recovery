### NordVPN

#### Best Apple TV VPN overall

NordVPN is one of the best Apple TV VPNs available.

The NordVPN user interface is clear and attractively laid out, and it couldn't be easier to install and set up. In the past, NordVPN limited its users to six simultaneous connections, but has since increased the limit to 10 devices under one account.

NordVPN, based in Panama, provides 111 country options within its server network, giving you plenty of options for streaming and accessing geo-restricted content. Available add-ons include browsing protection, anti-malware scanners, ad blockers, cloud storage, and a password manager.

This VPN is compatible with Apple TV and doesn't require any tampering with DNS settings to implement. The company operates NordVPN for tvOS, a [native Apple TV app](https://nordvpn.com/blog/introducing-nordvpn-for-tvos/) that you can download [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nordvpn-vpn-fast-secure/id905953485).

**Review:** [**NordVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nord-vpn-review-an-in-depth-look-at-a-popular-vpn/)

Prices start from $3.99 per month if you purchase two years of service, $4.99 per month for a one-year plan, or a standard month-to-month subscription coming in at $12.99 for basic protection. New users who subscribe to a two-year plan will receive free Sally eSim data.

Customers say they like the speed and stability of the VPN, and say support is top-notch. During our testing, we consistently found this VPN to be one of the fastest available.

### ExpressVPN

#### Best Apple TV VPN for speed

ExpressVPN is a popular VPN service that consistently provides strong stability and performance, and is our top pick for speed.

ExpressVPN has servers in 105 countries and offers up to eight simultaneous connections -- that is, you can protect up to eight devices simultaneously.

With the launch of tvOS 17, this VPN has a dedicated app for Apple TV. The software can be quickly downloaded from the App Store and installed on your device. If you have an older version of tvOS and cannot or do not want to update, you can use ExpressVPN's [MediaStreamer](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/stream-to-apple-tv-with-dns/) service as an alternative. 

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

Subscriptions begin at $6.67 per month if you buy a year of service upfront. ExpressVPN will also give you three months for free, added to the end of the contract term. Other plans available include $9.99 per month on a six-month plan and one month of access for $12.95.

Customers say they typically have a positive experience with this VPN provider and customer support is excellent. Some, however, also report automatic billing issues. During my testing, I found ExpressVPN to be a speedy, solid service, although on rare occasions, I did run up against IP-based website blocks.

**ExpressVPN features:** Apple TV compatibility: [Native app](https://www.expressvpn.com/vpn-download/vpn-apple-tv) | Smart DNS: [Yes](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/stream-to-apple-tv-with-dns/) | Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Countries: 105 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days

### Surfshark VPN

#### Best budget Apple TV VPN

Surfshark is the best option if you want a cheap VPN to disguise your activities and help you access geo-restricted content when using Apple TV.

Surfshark provides 3,200 servers in 100 countries with unlimited connections. The company [released](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fblog%2Fsurfshark-releases-vpn-for-apple-tv) a native Apple TV app in April 2024 for tvOS 17 and up. Alternatively, you can use Surfshark's Smart DNS feature, but keep in mind that this option is limited to a US location.

**Review**: [**Surfshark VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

Surfshark is one of the [most affordable VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-vpn/) on the market. Two-year plans start at $2.19 per month, plus three months of free access. Yearly plans offer the same number of free months, beginning at $2.79 per month. Monthly signups are expensive, with pricing starting at $15.45.

Surfshark customers say the service is easy to use, and customer support is excellent. In my speed testing, I found Surfshark's performance reasonable, especially considering the price point.

****Surfshark VPN features:** Apple TV compatibility: [Native app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/surfshark-vpn-fast-reliable/id1391782046) | Smart DNS: [Yes](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.surfshark.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360018689853-How-to-activate-Surfshark-Smart-DNS) | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Countries: 100 | Logging: None, except billing data | Money-back guarantee: 30 days

Pros 
* Good speeds

* Strong security

Cons

### Proton VPN

#### Best Apple TV VPN for security

Proton VPN, developed by engineers dedicated to online security, uses robust protocols and strong encryption to help mask your online activities. 

Proton VPN offers a kill switch, the benefit of open-source technologies, and a server network including 91 countries. It does not currently offer a native Apple TV app. You thus would need to use a workaround or install Proton VPN directly [onto your router](https://protonvpn.com/support/installing-protonvpn-on-a-router). 

**Review:** [**Proton VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/proton-vpn-review/)

The best deal is $4.49 per month on a two-year plan. Alternatively, Proton VPN's plans include 12 months for $4.99/month, while one month of access costs $9.99\. A free plan is also available.

Pros 
* Unlimited connections
* Native Apple TV app

Cons 
* Steep price increases after subscription ends
* No Smart DNS

### IPVanish

#### Best customizable Apple TV VPN

IPVanish is a strong contender in the VPN space and continues to be a popular option in the market today.

IPVanish [released](https://support.ipvanish.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002080093-Apple-TV) an Apple TV-compatible app with the release of tvOS 17\. If you can't use the native app, however, you may be out of luck, as IPVanish doesn't provide Smart DNS features beyond DNS leak protection. I wouldn't purchase this VPN purely for Apple TV, but across the board, it is a highly customizable option with fast connection speeds and solid transfers.

**Review:** [**IPVanish**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review-a-rich-wealth-of-options-and-surfing-controls/)

If you commit to two years, IPVanish offers a discounted plan for $2.19 per month. This increases to $2.79 per month for a yearly plan and $12.99 for a month-to-month subscription. 

IPVanish delivers a solid user experience overall. According to customer feedback, this VPN works well when streaming and while customers are abroad. I've also found this VPN to be very reliable. 

****IPVanish VPN features:** Apple TV compatibility: [Native app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ipvanish-ip-location-changer/id763638165) | Smart DNS: No | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: None, except billing data | Locations: 75 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days

## What is an Apple TV VPN service and why should you use one?

VPNs that provide a native app for Apple TV can be used to disguise your original IP address, giving you a relatively anonymous connection and the ability to access geo-restricted content.

Your VPN can also help disguise your activities from your ISP. This can be especially important if you are on a plan that throttles your traffic when your ISP detects streaming.

##  How to set up an Apple TV VPN 

There are different ways to use a VPN with your Apple TV setup. After Apple announced support for third-party VPNs with the release of tvOS 17 in 2023, many VPN providers began developing native apps for use with the operating system -- but not all of them.

If your chosen VPN provider offers a native Apple TV app, the process is simple. Head to the Apple App Store and select the search function to find your VPN app. Download the app, install it, and provide the VPN with any requested device permissions. Open the app and log in to the service via your Apple TV remote with your username, email, and password you created when you subscribed. Alternatively, some VPNs will allow you to log in through a QR code or access code on another device.

You also need to ensure that your Apple TV is up-to-date. To update your Apple TV, go to settings and find the software updates tab. Once your VPN has been installed, select a country or choose quick connect, and you should be good to go. 

If there is no native Apple TV app available, you may have to set up a VPN service on your router instead. Most VPN providers have extensive FAQ sections on their sites detailing how to complete a manual setup. It's best to reference those instructions for the specific VPN you're using, and to contact support if you have any issues. 

Alternatively, you can try a Smart DNS workaround. Smart DNS attempts to unblock geo-restricted content and services, even when there is no native VPN support available. Smart DNS is a feature made available by top VPN providers, but enabling it to work with your Apple TV will vary by provider.

For example, if you want to use [NordVPN](https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19564451081873-How-to-Set-Up-SmartDNS-on-Apple-TV)'s Smart DNS feature on your Apple TV rather than its native app, open the app, navigate to the Services section, select Smart DNS, and hit Activate. Go into your Apple TV dashboard, head to network settings, and choose Configure DNS, Manual. Input NordVPN's smart DNS server addresses, and select submit. The app will either generate Smart DNS settings for you, or you'll have to look up the addresses provided by your VPN service.

## How we test VPNs

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been talking about other VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for Apple TV below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our Apple TV VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive apps suitable for this hardware.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days.

## Factors to consider when choosing an Apple TV VPN

When you are selecting your new Apple TV VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Price**: One of the most significant factors in choosing a new VPN is the price. You tend to get the best deals on longer contracts, but you can still sign up for a month or so to try out a service if you prefer. We recommend avoiding free VPNs -- with a few exceptions -- as they may sell your data or bombard you with ads. Plans from reputable VPNs can often be as little as a few dollars a month, although you might have to pay tax on top.
* **Simultaneous connections**: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your Apple TV, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or laptop. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices. Thankfully, many paid VPN plans will now offer unlimited connections.
* **Contract length**: You must also decide how long you want a VPN. A two-year term tends to secure the best prices, but other options are available, including month-to-month plans, one-year terms, or, sometimes, even five-year contracts or lifetime subscriptions. After you've made a selection, there's typically a 30-day money-back guarantee.
* **Apps**: When selecting a VPN, try it first to ensure you like its accompanying app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but might not have a native Apple TV app available.
* **Servers**: When you are looking for a VPN to use with your Apple TV, it may be that the main reason is to access different libraries. So, check that the VPN you want to use has servers in the country or location you want before signing up.

##  VPN FAQs for Apple TV 

## Does Apple ban VPN use?

No. Since [2023](https://www.apple.com/si/newsroom/2023/06/tvos-17-brings-facetime-and-video-conferencing-to-apple-tv-4k/), Apple has provided support for third-party VPN providers, allowing these services to develop native applications compatible with its set-top box. Apple said the support was made available "to benefit enterprise and education users wanting to access content on their private networks, allowing Apple TV to be a great office and conference room solution in even more places," but it was also good news for consumers who want the additional features and security of a VPN.

## Is Smart DNS the same as a VPN?

On their own, Smart DNS services offered by VPNs do not provide the same protection or security as a VPN. A VPN allows you to change your location and IP address while creating an encrypted tunnel to mask your online activities and improve your online security. In comparison, Smart DNS only changes your IP address to hopefully unblock geo-restricted content.

## Is it worth getting a VPN just for my Apple TV?

Probably not. Unless you want a VPN to access geo-blocked content libraries, paying for a VPN service just for your Apple TV might not be worth your money. That said, the majority of VPN providers will give you more than one connection at a time (known as simultaneous connections), and so you can use your VPN to protect your PC, smartphone, and other devices at the same time. 

## Do I have to pay for an Apple TV VPN?

While there are [free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) and free VPN plans, the majority will come with speed, server, or device connection restrictions. For your Apple TV, we recommend that you sign up for a paid VPN plan so you don't have issues with Smart DNS functionality, speed, or security. 

## How do I tell if my VPN is safe?

First, choose a reputable VPN vendor with a strong security background. Then, to check that your VPN is working properly, compare your IP address before and after enabling a VPN connection. You can find this in your device's settings (typically under Wi-Fi) or by visiting [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). If you see the same IP address, your VPN is probably not working properly, as a VPN should assign you a new IP address.

You can also visit [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to see if any DNS leaks have been detected while using a VPN, which could be a sign that your information is being leaked. 

Finally, be careful with free VPNs offered by unknown or shady companies, especially if they are outside of official app repositories. This could open your device up to surveillance or malware. 

## Are Apple TV VPN services legal?

Apple TV VPN services are legal in the US, but the legality of using VPNs varies from country to country. 

Some countries, including North Korea, Belarus, and Iraq, ban VPNs outright, whereas others, such as Russia and China, do not approve of the use of non-state-controlled VPNs.

If you intend to use a VPN in another country, and you are unsure of its legality, you can check out NordVPN's [guide](https://nordvpn.com/blog/are-vpns-legal/).

## Are there alternative Apple TV VPNs to consider?

Other VPNs offering strong speeds and stability are also worth considering for your Apple TV. While it isn't possible to showcase every VPN, you might want to explore the options highlighted below.
