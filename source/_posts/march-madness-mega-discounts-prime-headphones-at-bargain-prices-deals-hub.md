## The best Nomad products to shop at 20% off

[Nomad Sport Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fsport-case-white-iphone-15-pro-max%3F) 

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Nomad's Sport case is available for the various iPhone 13, 14, and 15 models. 

ZDNET's Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner says that the Sport Case for iPhone is protective, easy-to-grip, lightweight, and notes that it has a very distinctive look. 

"The attention to detail is apparent in the slight indent down the sides of the case that make easier to hold and the notched lines in the metal power button that have a wonderful tactile feel," Hiner says.

Nomad offers a range of flagship chargers in varying configurations. The Base One Max combines wireless charging for your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods in one. 

**Also:** [Apple fans will dig this stylish new 3-in-1 charger from Nomad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-fans-will-dig-this-stylish-new-3-in-1-charger-from-nomad/) 

ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes reviewed the Base One Max in 2023, and he immediately called out its top quality. "The first thing that I noticed about the Base One Max was how solid, well-built, and premium it felt. In a world where a lot of charging stations can be too lightweight and feel plasticky, this one's constructed from solid metal, premium glass, and dust and scratch-resistant TPU giving it both a heft and presence on a desk or nightstand," he said in [his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-fans-will-dig-this-stylish-new-3-in-1-charger-from-nomad/). 

With 20% off, you can save over $30 on this all-in-one charger -- a deal that doesn't come around often.

[Nomad Sport Band for Apple Watch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fsport-band-white%3F) 

Matthew Miller/ZDNet

Nomad's Sport Band for Apple Watch is availale for virtually all models of the Apple Watch and comes in several colors and combinations. 

**Also:** [**Nomad just made the boldest Apple Watch accessory, and I expect it to sell out**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomad-just-made-the-boldest-apple-watch-accessory-yet-and-i-expect-it-to-sell-out-soon/)

Hiner says it looks great, is comfortable to wear, and is very durable. And at a retail price of $60, it sits nicely between Apple's Sport band ($50) and its Ocean Band ($100) designed for the Apple Watch Ultra. With a 20% off discount, the Nomad Sport Band is a terrific deal.

[Nomad Titanium Band for Apple Watch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmetal-band-titanium-silver-44mm) 

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

Nomad's Titanium band for Apple Watch is ZDNET's Matthew Miller's favorite watch strap. The only downside? It's a pricey investment at $300, and hasn't gone on sale in over two years. During the spring sale, you can snag a titanium watch band for 20% off -- a $60 savings.

**Also:** [**My favorite Apple Watch Ultra band is not made by Apple**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-apple-watch-ultra-accessory-is-back-in-stock-and-its-not-made-by-apple/)

In 2023, Miller tested the titanium band for over a month, and liked its high-end look, great clasp, and overall feel. 

"While Apple has a Link Bracelet available for $349\. Nomad's $300 Titanium Band is a better option with two colors to choose from, a full-release magnetic clasp, a link adjustment tool, and more. It's a lovely metal accessory that has instantly made my Apple Watch experience all the more premium," Miller said in [his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-apple-watch-ultra-accessory-is-back-in-stock-and-its-not-made-by-apple/).
