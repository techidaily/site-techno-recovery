## Modernizing the Papacy? Understanding Pope Francis's Approach to Using Email
 Although His Holiness Pope Francis might have a private or official email address, he does maintain a publicly listed email address. People who wish to contact him by modern means aren't relegated to snail mail as he has an active[social media feed](https://twitter.com/Pontifex) .

## Contact the Pope Through the Mail

 For contacting Pope Francis through the postal service, the Vatican provides this address:

 **His Holiness, Pope Francis**
 **Apostolic Palace**
 **00120 Vatican City**

 Don't add "Italy" to the address. The Vatican is a separate political entity from Italy.

## The Pope Doesn't Use Email

 Despite his lack of email accessibility, Pope Francis sees modern communication options as beneficial. When[Tim Cook, Apple's CEO](https://www.lifewire.com/who-is-tim-cook-1994301) , visited the Vatican in January 2016, Pope Francis released a message titled   _Communication and Mercy: A Fruitful Encounter, for the 50th World Day of Social Communications_ . In it, he said that the internet, text messages, and social networks are "gifts from God."

## Other Popes in the Information Age

 Unlike their current successor, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II had email addresses: <benedictxvi@vatican.va> and john\_paul\_ii@vatican.va, respectively. Both might have had other private email addresses inside the Vatican, as well.

 Karol JÃ³zef Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II in 1978 before people used email widely and practically. The[first email](https://www.lifewire.com/first-email-message-1164184) had been written seven years previous to his ascendancy, but few people outside the computer programming field knew computer networks existed. Yet, John Paul II became the first email-savvy pontiff in history and the first to be canonized in centuries.

 In late 2001, the pope [apologized for injustices committed by the Roman Catholic Church in Oceania via email](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1671540.stm) . The Holy Father would have preferred to visit the Pacific nations and deliver his words of penitence in person, but email made for an effective second-best choice.
