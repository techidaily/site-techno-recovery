## Easy Ways to Link Your Samsung Remote Control and Televisions
### What to Know

* Turn the TV on and locate its IR receiver. It's usually on the lowest portion of the TV.
* Point your remote at the IR receiver, and press-and-hold the**Return** and**Play/Pause** buttons.
* Wait for the success message to appear on the TV.

 This article explains how to pair a Samsung remote to a TV.

## How Do I Pair My Samsung Remote to My TV?

 Your Samsung Smart Remote is designed to automatically connect to your new Samsung TV when you first get it, but you can also pair it manually if you need to. If you get a new remote, or you want to connect your Samsung Smart Remote to a different Samsung TV, then you can use this manual connection procedure.  

 Your Samsung remote can only control one TV at a time. If you pair your remote to a new TV, you will have to go through this procedure again if you want to use it with the original TV in the future.

1. Turn on your Samsung TV using the power button on the TV or a remote that’s already paired.
2. Locate the remote control sensor on the TV—it's usually on the lower right side, but it may be on the bottom center—and point your remote at it.
3. On the remote, press-and-hold the**Return** and**Play/Pause** buttons simultaneously for at least three seconds.
4. Watch the screen for a successful pairing message. Depending on your TV or remote, it might say**Pairing Complete** , or you'll see a**green circle** .  
 If the message on your TV says**Not Available** or there's a**red X** , try to pair the remote again.[Contact Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fcontact%2F) for further assistance if it still doesn’t work.

## How Do I Reset My Samsung Remote Control?

 If your Samsung remote is malfunctioning, you may need to reset it. The reset procedure requires removal of the batteries, so this is a good time to insert new batteries if you haven’t done so in a while. Weak batteries can also cause a lot of issues.

 Here’s how to reset a Samsung remote control:  

1. Remove the batteries from the remote.
2. Wait at least eight seconds.
3. Put the batteries back in, or insert new batteries.
4. Pair the remote to your TV using the procedure from the previous section.

## What if My Samsung Remote Still Won’t Pair?

 If your remote won’t pair, and you don’t see an error message on your TV, then you need to verify that it’s actually sending an[infrared (IR) signal](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ir-remote-control-5194485) to your TV. While the IR signals sent by your remote are invisible to the naked eye, it will show up in the camera app on your phone.  
  
 Here’s how to make sure your Samsung remote is transmitting an IR signal:

1. Open the camera app on your phone.
2. Point the remote at your phone, so that you can see the front of the remote in your camera app.  
 You can also use a digital camera if it has a live view LCD display and not just an optical viewfinder.
3. Push a button on the remote, like the**power** or**volume** button.  
 Some Samsung remotes use Bluetooth for every button but the power button, so the power button is the best one to use for this test.
4. If the remote sends a signal, you’ll see the IR transmitter light up in your camera app.  
 If you don’t see anything light up, try replacing the batteries in the remote. If that doesn’t help, the remote may need to be replaced. Contact Samsung to see if the remote is still under warranty.
