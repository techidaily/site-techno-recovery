## How to Recover Deleted Numbers on Android

 You signed in to your Google account when you first up your Android. By default, your contacts sync with your Google account. Any contacts you delete will go to the Google Contacts trash folder. Here's how to recover a deleted contact or phone number from a computer or your phone:

1. [Open Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/) in your web browser. You'll need to log in with the same Google account used on your phone.  
 If you're on your phone, find and open the**Contacts** app.
2. Select**Trash** from the menu on the left. If you don't see it, select the**three-line** menu button at the top left.

 To do this from the mobile app, go to**Fix & manage** \>**Trash** .
3. Select a contact from the list.

 Need help finding what you're after? Contacts sent to the trash are permanently deleted every 30 days so that you might have missed your opportunity. Additionally, if your phone hasn't been backing up your contacts, deleted entries will not appear here.

## How to Get Deleted Numbers Back on a Samsung Phone

 It's easy to recover deleted contacts on a Samsung phone because there's a handy recycle bin area that stores this information. You have 30 days to get a deleted phone number back before it disappears forever. Here's how:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Battery and device care** \>**Storage** .
2. From the**Recycle bin** section, tap**Contacts** .
3. Select a contact from the list and tap**Restore** .

 Although it's not as common, your phone might have contacts stored on the internal memory or a SIM card. This can happen if that's where you've backed up your contacts. If you're lucky, the deleted number might still exist in the backup. Here's how to import those contacts:

1. Go to**Contacts** \>**Menu** \>**Manage Contacts.**  
![The Samsung Contacts app with the menu and 'Manage contacts' highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hGdu49Zvk3-BMwVJhDJRUg3hUkc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RetrieveDeletedNumbers06-ac12a6b7ae344c169bc47cddcde5b324.jpg)
2. Tap**Import or export contacts** \>**Import** . If you have any contacts stored on your SIM card or your internal memory, you'll see those sources in the list.
3. Select the source you want to retrieve the contacts from, then tap**Import** .
