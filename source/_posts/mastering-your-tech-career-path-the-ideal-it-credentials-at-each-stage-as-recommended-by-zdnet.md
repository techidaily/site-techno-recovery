## Mastering Your Tech Career Path: The Ideal IT Credentials at Each Stage, as Recommended by ZDNet

IT certifications offer a quick and relatively inexpensive way to enter or enhance an IT career. These credentials may focus on entry-level fundamentals or system and network concentrations for management and specialized careers.

Information technology certifications can provide professionals with the training, skills, and credentials necessary to enter the IT field or move within it. 

Today, skilled IT professionals are in high demand and benefit from remote working opportunities. The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) (BLS) projects 13% growth for all computer occupations between 2020 and 2030\. The computer and information technology sector pays median annual wages of $91,250\. 

Throughout this page, we explore the value of IT certifications and examine some of the leading credentials for entry-level and experienced IT professionals, plus the certifications with the highest earning potential.

## What is information technology?

Information technology includes the hardware, software, and devices that store, process, and manage information. Studies in this field cover the uses, implementation, and optimization of these technologies.

Within many organizations, IT departments take on responsibilities including: 

**Operations:** Operations professionals focus on providing technical support to users, managing and maintaining network performance, and device management. 

**Infrastructure installation and maintenance:** Infrastructure professionals implement and configure systems and devices. They provide troubleshooting and maintenance when required. 

**Governance:** Governance professionals oversee the IT policies and procedures within an organization. They establish IT strategies and goals and provide leadership.

## What is an IT certification?

IT certifications exhibit a professional's mastery over a specific discipline, technology, or field. The credentials may feature both condensed training and an exam or only one of these components. 

IT certifications may provide entry-level, intermediate, or advanced training and credentials.

Professionals can pursue certifications to enter the IT field, change positions, or advance their careers. 

The credentials can showcase a professional's expertise with a specific vendor's technology, which may be extremely valuable for employers who use those systems.

They also demonstrate determination and drive for personal and professional improvement. 

### IT certification cost

The cost of an IT certification varies. Some platforms feature a monthly fee, such as Coursera, which charges between $29-$99\. First-time participants can get a free trial period.

Most certifications have an exam fee between $99-$999\. These credentials often allow candidates to study on their own for free, though paid study materials or instructor-led classes are usually available. 

### What's the difference between certifications and degrees in information technology?

Though they can have similar outcomes, IT certifications and degrees feature significant differences. 

In contrast to highly focused and accelerated certifications, degrees combine general education and core training over 2- to 4-year periods. Many [information technology degrees](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-online-information-technology-degrees/) offer specialization options and courses like information systems fundamentals, enterprise network design, and cybersecurity. 

While both associate degrees and certain certifications can lead to entry-level careers, many advanced and [high-paying IT roles](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-careers-with-it-degree/) require a bachelor's degree in IT or higher. 

### What's the difference between information technology certificates and certifications?

An information technology certificate is an education program thattrains learners in a specific IT field. Compared to degree-granting IT programs, an information technology certificate takes less time and does not include general education courses. Most certificate programs take 4-12 months. 

Certifications are granted by third-party providers who meet industry-wide specifications, while a certificate is generally earned through a college or other learning platform. Both undergraduate and graduate certificates are available. 

By comparison, a certification generally does not require classes. Instead, candidates meet experience or education prerequisites and pass an examination. 

Some certificate programs offer a credential upon completion, including the [IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=40328&u1=zd-50665163a10c4101a145bd3d491dc677-&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fibm-cybersecurity-analyst&fobs=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) in the list below.
