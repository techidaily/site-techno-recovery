## Navigating the Pros and Cons of Having Multiple YouTube Presence: A Guide

Close 

 YouTube lets you make multiple channels using one email address. It's as easy as logging in to your existing account and clicking a couple of buttons to[ set up the new channel](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-channel-setup-guide-1082492) . If you want, you can also tie a Brand Account tied to your personal account, which you can use for business or branding purposes.

##  Your Options for Several Channels

 If you only want to keep family videos out of the public eye, you can use your regular YouTube account and[ adjust the privacy settings](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-privacy-settings-1082507) of individual videos. However, if you have two different audiences for your content, it's better to set up different channels. 

### Multiple Channels

 In the past, you would create a separate YouTube account for each audience, and that method still works. To do it, just create a new Gmail account for every YouTube channel you want to create. 

 However, that's not the only—or necessarily the best—option. Another way to get multiple YouTube channels is to click the new channel option from your existing account.

### Brand Account

 Yet another type of account you can get on YouTube is a Brand Account. They're a little like Facebook Pages, so they're separate accounts that are managed by proxy by your personal account—usually for commercial purposes.

 With a YouTube Brand Account, the connection to your personal Google account isn't displayed, and you can share management of the account or manage it by yourself.

 The directions below are for making a new regular YouTube channel, so you'll need different instructions if you plan to[ make a Brand Account](https://www.lifewire.com/create-a-youtube-business-account-2655503) .

2. Click**Create a new channel** .  
 If you already have a YouTube channel that you manage, you'll see it listed here, and you can click it to switch to it. If you already have a Brand Account but haven't set it up as a YouTube channel, you'll see the name listed separately under**Brand Accounts for** . Select it.

##  Managing Your New YouTube Channels

 You can manage this new YouTube channel just like you do your personal account. Any comments you make on videos from this account show up as having come from that account, not any of your other ones.

 Consider adding different channel icons—the user profile image on YouTube—to distinguish which account you're using. Taking this step also makes it easier for you to keep track of which account you're actively logged in to, and also lets subscribers and visitors differentiate your accounts.

 Switch between accounts by using the channel switcher link in Step 1 above, or by clicking your**profile picture** \> selecting**Switch account** \> and choosing the account you'd like to view.
