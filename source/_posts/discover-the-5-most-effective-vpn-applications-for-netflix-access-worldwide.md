5) Follow the on-screen wizard to reset a password.

Sometimes you may be redirected to [way 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  where you need to enter a recovery email address. This is somehow upsetting . But imagine this: if someone knows the answer to your security question, then he can access your Gmail account. This is horrible, isn’t it? So don’t blame Google. Google’s been strict with security and privacy, so you’ll need to verify your ownership ofthis Gmail account to log in.

 These are the solutions you can try to**recover your Gmail password** if you’ve forgotten your password of Gmail. Feel free to comment below if you have any questions, and we’ll see what more we can do to further help.
