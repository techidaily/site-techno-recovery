Sometimes you may be redirected to [way 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  where you need to enter a recovery email address. This is somehow upsetting . But imagine this: if someone knows the answer to your security question, then he can access your Gmail account. This is horrible, isn’t it? So don’t blame Google. Google’s been strict with security and privacy, so you’ll need to verify your ownership ofthis Gmail account to log in.
