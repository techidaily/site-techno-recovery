The skyrocketing interest in [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) and recent layoffs have caused workers to experience a lot of job insecurity in the tech job market. However, a new report shows that picking up one of these ten tech skills could increase your marketability to employers, and even your salary. 

On Wednesday, Indeed shared a [list](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/news/highest-paid-skills-tech) of the top ten highest-paid skills in tech, as well as a quick glimpse at the tech job market, which isn't as bleak as you might think.

This past January, 30,995 tech employees were laid off, and even though that sounds like a high number, it was "barely" one-third of the employees laid off last January, according to the report.

The good news for job seekers is the number one skill on Indeed's highest-paid tech skills list -- generative AI -- can be learned through deep dives into free but high-quality [online courses from Amazon](https://www.zdnet.com/article/unlock-ai-secrets-transform-your-skills-with-amazons-free-ai-learning/), [IBM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/have-10-hours-ibm-will-train-you-in-ai-fundamentals-for-free/), and [other reputable companies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-took-this-free-ai-course-for-developers-in-one-weekend-and-highly-recommend-it/), which ZDNET has covered at length.

In fact, the majority of the highest-paid skills in tech are related to AI in some capacity, with generative AI, System-on-chip (SoC), and [deep learning](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-deep-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/) in the first three spots.

The average salary potential for workers with generative AI and SoC skills is around $174,000, with a 47% difference in salary potential with the skill versus those without. Employees with skills in deep learning trail slightly behind with an average salary potential of $170,939, and a 44% difference with the skill. 

The rest of the skills all range between the $165,000 to $169,000 salary potential and include Torch, PyTorch, Computer vision, SystemVerilog, Mesos, Rust, and Elixir. You can find each skill's description, average salary potential, and percent difference in the chart below.
