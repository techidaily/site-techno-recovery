## How to Fix Ac1st16.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download ac1st16.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore ac1st16.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" ac1st16.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the ac1st16.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 This file is most likely related to an older version of an [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) program, like[DWG TrueView](https://www.autodesk.com/viewers) or[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) (version 2006, and possibly others). However, your particular DLL file might be used with some other kind of software.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the ac1st16.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some ac1st16.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the ac1st16.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to ac1st16.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file ac1st16.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The ac1st16.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
5. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if ac1st16.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
6. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair ac1st16.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid ac1st16.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
