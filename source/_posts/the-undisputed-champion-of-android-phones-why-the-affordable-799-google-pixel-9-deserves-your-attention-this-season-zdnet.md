I had a chance to attend the [Made by Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-announced-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) event earlier this month, and after the keynote wrapped up, I was more excited to go hands-on with the baseline version of the [Pixel 9](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/config/pixel%5F9) than the Pro or the Pro XL. Why? Because the Pixel 9's accessibility makes it a fascinating device, and one I recommend for a handful of reasons. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Google Pixel 9 The Google Pixel 9 is an impressive smartphone for under $1,000 with improved design, camera, and a host of AI features that are actually useful. View at Google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/config/pixel%5F9?hl=en-US)

I'm spoiling this review right at the top, but it's true. Google's new entry-level flagship, the Pixel 9, starts at $799 ($100 more than last year's version) and even though its hardware is a minor improvement over the Pixel 8, it's an impressive phone overall. It offers a new design, slightly upgraded performance, slightly better cameras, a slightly bigger battery, and a host of new AI features.

Google has positioned the Pixel 9 as the default Android alternative to the iPhone 15 (soon to be the iPhone 16), partly because it looks like one. Google gave the entire Pixel 9 family flat sides with rounded corners, which makes it look like something from a design lab in Cupertino. The good news is that it makes these phones look and feel great. 

**Also: [I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra with the Pixel 9 Pro XL for two weeks - and can't go back](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-pixel-9-pro-xl-for-two-weeks-and-cant-go-back/)**

In fact, they're my favorite-looking Pixel phones yet. The Pixel 9 feels especially unique while still offering a premium feel that's blissfully cold to the touch when you pick it up. The sides are aluminum, while the front and back feature Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2\. The whole thing is IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, and it's just the right size for use with one hand.

Another characteristic of the Pixel is its nice display, and the Pixel 9 definitely has one. It features a 6.3-inch Actua display a tenth of an inch bigger than the Pixel 8\. The sharp 2424x1080 resolution, OLED panel, and 120Hz dynamic refresh rate give the Pixel 9 exceptional visuals whether you're just reading email or watching your favorite movie. This year, the screen can reach way up to 2,700 nits of brightness, making it one of the brightest Android phones you can buy.

Also, its performance feels better. Powered by the new Tensor G4 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage, the Pixel 9 is a screamer. It's one of the most responsive Android phones I've used all year, and that's just with the standard version of this phone.

The cameras are also impressive. Google kept the same 50MP main camera as last year but swapped the old 12MP ultra-wide for a new 48MP 123-degree camera. Photos are simply stunning on this phone, and Google's post-processing algorithms do a great job of retaining details and contrast. Video quality is also very good, especially with the company's Video Boost technology. This phone can easily rival any device that costs $200+ more.

If there's a downside to the hardware, it's the inclusion of the lower-quality 10.5MP selfie camera, whereas the Pro phones get a new 42MP camera. There's also an extra telephoto camera on the Pros, so you won't get the same zoom quality on the regular Pixel 9.

Regarding this phone's AI features, Google has jammed quite a bit into the Pixel 9\. Not only does it ship with the company's Gemini chatbot out of the box, but thanks to the Tensor G4 processor, it also comes with Gemini Live, so you can have real-life conversations with it. 

**Also: [Android 15's Gemini overlay feature can answer questions about anything on your screen](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-15s-gemini-ai-assistant-can-answer-questions-about-anything-on-your-screen/)**

It requires a Google One AI Premium plan, but you'll get one for free if you buy a Pixel 9\. I've asked it numerous questions that were similar to web queries ("What's the best place to live near New York City that's relatively affordable," "How many stars are in the skyâ€“wait, in the galaxy?") and it answered them all with ease -- even with speech interruptions. It's in the early stages, but it's exciting technology that could change how we use our phones.

You also get features like [Add Me](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-google-pixel-9-pros-add-me-feature-is-an-ar-camera-tool-youll-actually-use/), which allows you to take a picture of your friends, then have them take a picture of you in the same place, and merge the two so no one's left out. I've played around with it during my testing, which worked surprisingly well. There are also some nice updates to [Magic Editor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-three-ai-features-sold-me-on-the-google-pixel-9-pro-and-theyre-very-clever/) for framing your photos.

Google also included two new AI-powered apps on the Pixel 9 series: [Pixel Screenshots](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-googles-pixel-screenshots-and-its-everything-id-want-an-ai-feature-to-be/) and [Pixel Studio](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9s-new-ai-photo-editing-features-can-fix-just-about-any-poorly-captured-image/). With the former, you can organize your screenshots and search through them with AI prompts, allowing you to easily reference information like Wi-Fi passwords or recipes. 

Meanwhile, the latter lets you generate images on the fly and customize them with text, stickers, and other effects. I've enjoyed using both apps in my limited testing time, but I'll need to play with them over the long run to see whether they're worth it.

**Also: [The Pixel phone camera was already the best, but these new features make it even better](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-pixel-phone-camera-was-already-the-best-but-these-new-features-make-it-even-better/)**

I found battery life to be quite good. There's a 4,700mAh cell inside that can last all day on a charge and then some, which means you won't need to worry about this phone's battery after a long day. Google includes 45W charging support on the Pixel 9 series, which is awesome, but you'll need to buy a separate wall adapter to take advantage of it. In addition, there's 15W wireless charging (not Qi2, notably) and 5W reverse wireless charging called "Battery Share."

## ZDNET's buying advice

If your budget is $800, it's hard not to recommend [Google's Pixel 9](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/config/pixel%5F9). Sure, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a tough competitor, but I actually think this is the better buy. It gives you access to some useful new AI features, and you get all the perks of the Pixel experience, like excellent software, display quality, and cameras. 

The Pixel 9's Pro and Pro XL versions might be flashier, but the baseline version of Google's flagship phone should not be overlooked.
