## How to Disable Amber Alerts and Other iPhone Emergency Alerts

1. Tap the[Settings](https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-device-settings-4138532) app to open it, then tap**Notifications** .
2. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to find the section labeled**Government Alerts** . Amber alerts and Public Safety Alerts are set to on/green by default; tap a toggle to switch that alert off.
3. Tap**Emergency Alerts** for a few other options. From there, you can control emergency alerts without affecting the option you chose for Amber alerts in the last step. This is also how you stop emergency alerts from bypassing silent mode.

## Can Do Not Disturb Silence Emergency and Amber Alerts on iPhone?

 The[iPhone's Do Not Disturb feature](https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-iphone-apple-watch-2000547) lets you silence notifications, but it does not work with Amber alerts and other emergency alerts. Because they signal an emergency that could affect your life and safety or someone else's, Do Not Disturb can't block these alerts.

 There is no way to block or silence Amber alerts except by turning them off. As for emergency alerts, there is a toggle called**Always Play Sound** that you can turn off (see Step 3 above). Doing this prevents the sound from coming through your phone when you're in silent mode.

## Can You Change Emergency and Amber Alert Tones on iPhone?

 While you can[change the sound used for other alerts](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-the-default-ringtone-on-your-iphone-2000554) , you can't customize emergency alert sounds. Yes, the noise for these alerts is unpleasant and may even be startling, but it's worth remembering that they're unpleasant because they're supposed to get your attention.

## Why You Shouldn't Disable Amber and Emergency Alerts on iPhone

 Even though these alerts can sometimes be surprising or unwelcome, you should leave them on—especially the emergency alerts. These messages arrive when there is dangerous weather or another severe health or safety event imminent in your area. If a tornado, flash flood, or other potential natural disaster is heading your way, you'll want to know so that you can take action.

[Emergency](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/emergency-alert-system-eas) and[Amber alerts](https://amberalert.ojp.gov/) go out rarely and only in specific situations. Given that, the disruption they cause is minor compared to the benefits they offer.
