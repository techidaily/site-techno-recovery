## Choosing Your Digital Sidekick: Alexa Vs. Google Assistant - Find the Ideal Match

 Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa-powered devices are the two leading smart speaker lines for a reason.

 Both come in various form factors, function quite well as virtual assistants, allow you to control a variety of smart home devices, and go toe to toe right down the line with various other features and functions.

 There are important differences, and we'll outline them for you. In this scenario, we'll use the[**Amazon Echo Studio**](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799917%7Cnf1ca24213f174622bf01f6cf06cea29017%7C) and[**Google Nest Audio**](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Audio-Bluetooth-Speaker-Keychain/dp/B0CL7P33RH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799917%7Cnf1ca24213f174622bf01f6cf06cea29017%7C) for the hardware comparison.

## Overall Findings

 Amazon Echo Studio

* Uses Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant.
* Tied into the Amazon ecosystem, great for shopping.
* Excellent third party skill support.

 Google Nest Audio

* Uses the Google Assistant virtual assistant.
* Fantastic AI with realistic speech and a lot of accent options.
* Growing support for third party skills.

 Google's and Amazon's smart speakers are somewhat unique compared to most other types of electronics, as the hardware isn't updated often, but the underlying software is in constant flux. These platforms are[artificial intelligence](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-artificial-intelligence-5119206) \-driven, with[Google Assistant](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911) on one side and[Alexa](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107) on the other, and the development cycle for these virtual assistants is never-ending.

 Nest Audio and Echo Studio are fairly evenly matched on most points, with minor differences in hardware that aren't likely to tip the scales for most people. The AI-driven virtual assistants are what make each platform interesting, and that's where the most important differences come into play.

 Alexa has historically been the one to beat in terms of skills, especially third-party[Alexa skills](https://www.lifewire.com/alexa-skills-4126799) , which add additional functionality. However, Google has made up enough ground in that department that you're better off checking whether each system has the specific skills you need rather than making a choice based on how many skills each one offers.

Amazon Echo Studio .

 Alexa is predictably better in terms of online shopping since it's connected so deeply to the Amazon ecosystem, while we're more impressed overall with Google's AI technology, including their speech recognition and voice generation.

## Design: Nobody's Winning Any Awards

 Amazon Echo Studio

* Cylindrical; 8.1 x 6.9 inches
* Two colors: charcoal and glacier.

 Google Nest Audio

* Cylindrical; 6.89 x 4.89 inches
* Five colors: chalk, charcoal, sage, sand, and sky.

 Neither Google nor Amazon are physical product companies, which tends to show through in their devices' overall design and aesthetics.

 The Nest Audio and Echo Studio devices aren't ugly, and both companies have made efforts to make them easier to incorporate into homes, but the designs aren't terribly inspired.

 The Nest Audio, however, takes up less shelf space and looks more elegant.

## Music: Sound & Compatibility

 Google Nest Audio

* Works with a variety of music streaming services.
* Bluetooth streaming available.
* 133 mm woofer and 20 mm tweeter.

 Amazon Echo Studio

* Works with a variety of music streaming services.
* Bluetooth streaming available.
* 75 mm woofer and 19 mm tweeter.

 For the average person, comparing speakers mostly depends on which music streaming services they work with and how they sound. In this case, you can't really go wrong with either speaker.

 The Nest Audio's woofer is smaller than the Echo Studio's, so you might opt for Amazon's speaker for better bass. But, both will work with basically any[music streaming service](https://www.lifewire.com/top-places-to-listen-to-free-music-online-1356649) ; Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora are just a few examples.

## Voice Controls and Skills: Google Is Closing in Fast

 Amazon Echo Studio

* Several wake words, including Alexa, Echo, Amazon, and computer.
* Several voice options; pick from different accents, celebrity voices, and languages.
* Has historically led in third party skills.
* Getting better at general knowledge, but still better at shopping.

 Google Nest Audio

* "Okay Google" and "Hey Google" wake words.
* Lots of voice and accent options, some sound better than others.
* Has lagged behind in skills, but is closing the gap.
* Draws on Google's extensive Knowledge Graph and powerful AI technology.

 The virtual assistants in the Nest Audio and Echo Studio operate well, with natural-sounding voice options and decent speech recognition.

 One big difference is that the Nest Audio only answers to two similar wake words, while the Echo Studio can be triggered by unique words like "computer" or "Amazon."

 Both systems offer good speech recognition, although the Google Assistant-driven Nest Audio is better at answering general knowledge questions and parsing web-based queries.

 Alexa gets stuck if you don't use specific wording and relies more on Wikipedia. You need to add a skill for some questions, as Alexa simply can't answer them alone.

 In terms of third-party skills that provide additional functionality, Alexa has historically held the lead.

 However, Google has closed the gap to the point where the distinction is no longer as important.

 If you need your virtual assistant to interface with a specific device or technology or perform a particular function, check to see which platform has the appropriate skill before you choose, as it's no longer safe to assume Alexa will and Google Assistant won't.

## Smart Home Integration and Connectivity

 Amazon Echo Studio

* Excellent compatibility with smart home devices.
* Compatible with Fire TV.
* Can make "drop in" calls to other Echo devices and phones.

 Google Nest Audio

* Excellent compatibility with smart home devices.
* Compatible with Chromecast.
* Broadcast messages and make calls.

 Both the Nest Audio and Echo Studio are great at forming the backbone of a smart home. Echo Studio works with every Works with Alexa device across protocols like Matter and Zigbee. Google lists all the[smart home companies Nest Audio is compatible with](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest%5Faudio%5Fapps?hl=en-US&category=smarthome) ; it's a decent list.

 It's worth checking to see if your existing smart home devices are compatible with Nest Audio before investing in the speaker, but it can do pretty much everything Alexa can in terms of controlling lights, thermostats, garage doors, and other smart home tech.

 Nest Audio works out of the box with Chromecast, while Fire TV is built to work with Alexa. This is relevant if you've already invested in smart TV hardware from either company.

 Both the Nest Audio and Echo Studio are versatile in their communication capabilities. Whether it's broadcasting audio messages to other speakers in the same home or making hands-free calls over the internet, these speakers have you covered. Nest Audio uses Google Meet or Google Voice, while Echo Studio can call up to 10 numbers and make calls with any Alexa-enabled device. They're both reliable options for your smart home needs.

 For raw connectivity, both Google and Amazon devices connect to your home Wi-Fi. We've found that Echo devices provide a slightly more robust connection and work in places and at distances where Google speakers do not.

## Final Verdict: Primarily a Question of Which Ecosystem You’d Rather Get Stuck In

 Amazon pulled out to an early lead with better speech recognition and more third-party skill support, but Google has closed that gap to the point where the difference isn't big enough to recommend one over the other.

[View on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799917%7Cnf1ca24213f174622bf01f6cf06cea29017%7C)

 Google Assistant is a slightly better and smarter virtual assistant. At the same time, Alexa works well enough in general-purpose settings and excels in integrating with Amazon's online shopping experience.

[View on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Audio-Bluetooth-Speaker-Keychain/dp/B0CL7P33RH?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799917%7Cnf1ca24213f174622bf01f6cf06cea29017%7C)

 When deciding between Nest Audio and Echo Studio, the most important question is whether you're more deeply entrenched in the Google or Amazon ecosystem. The most crucial difference between these two assistants is how well they work with Google and Amazon's exclusive devices and services.

 If you're new to smart homes and virtual assistants but you're a regular Amazon shopper with an Amazon Prime subscription, choosing Alexa provides a familiar and user-friendly experience that can be a safe and reassuring choice.

 Otherwise, you'll have to decide if you prefer the slightly better-looking Nest Audio, the Echo Studio's better connectivity, or if any of the other features we've highlighted help tip the scales in your favor.
