## Discover the Greatest Free Defrag Solutions of 2024 - Ranked
 After several years of using various disk defragmenter programs, I've compiled this list of the absolute best free options. These recommendations are based on my experiences with these types of apps on my PC.

 All versions of Windows include a built-in defrag program, which I've ranked in this list. However, in most cases, a dedicated program will do a better job.  

[How Often Should You Defrag Your Computer?](https://www.lifewire.com/how-often-should-you-defrag-3976922)

 This list includes only[freeware](https://www.lifewire.com/freeware-definition-4154271) . In other words, only_completely_ free defragmentation programs. While I used[shareware](https://www.lifewire.com/shareware-definition-4154860) and trialware while compiling this list, I've purposefully left those options out so that you can pick from only the truly free options. If one of these programs has started charging, please[let us know](https://www.lifewire.com/mailto:feedback@lifewire.com) .

## [Smart Defrag](https://www.lifewire.com/smart-defrag-review-2619163)

![Smart Defrag disk defrag tab](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXqJPBFs4h9ptryP1X4mnGitSgQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/smart-defrag-9-80c0adc5713e43ada965070a8fe9ea5c.png)

 What We Like

* Will run a defrag automatically on a schedule
* A defrag can run while the computer is booting up
* Files you access often can be moved to faster parts of the drive
* A portable version is available
* Can clean up the drive before the defrag to speed it up
* Lots of options for post-defrag, like to reboot
* Exclusions can be applied to the defrag

 What We Don't Like

* Some of the features are only usable if you pay
* Can't defrag automatically when the computer is idle
* Setup might attempt to install another program

[Our Review of Smart Defrag](https://www.lifewire.com/smart-defrag-review-2619163)

 The main reason I list Smart Defrag as the #1 best free defrag program is because it's great at scheduling an automatic defrag. I also appreciate the boot time defrag ability to remove fragments from[locked files](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-locked-file-2625928) .

 Smart Defrag can also exclude files and folders from a defrag/analysis and skip defragging files that are over a certain file size.

 Also included is a feature that removes junk files in Windows. It also[clears cache files](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-temporary-files-in-windows-2624709) in other parts of Windows that could help speed up a defrag.

 I've used this program countless times over the years, and it's one of the top few that I recommend first to anyone who wants a great defrag utility that doesn't cost anything. Its advanced toggles are ideal for anyone who likes those types of options.

 Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP users can install and use Smart Defrag.

 What We Like

* Defrags can be run automatically on a schedule
* Can run a defrag during reboot
* You can defrag specific files and folders
* Data can be excluded from the defrag
* Can be run directly from File Explorer
* Lets you move lesser-used fragmented files to the very end of the drive

 What We Don't Like

* Might be confusing if you don't want to deal with all the extra options
* Doesn't support idle defragging
* No update since 2018

[Our Review of Defraggler](https://www.lifewire.com/defraggler-review-2619158)

 Piriform's Defraggler tool is easily one of the best free defrag software programs out there. It can defrag the data or just the free space of an internal or [external drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-external-drive-2625867) . You also have the option of defragmenting specific files or folders and nothing more.

 The program can also run a boot time defrag, check a drive for errors, empty the Recycle Bin before defragging, exclude certain files from a defrag, run an idle defrag, and selectively move lesser-used files to the end of the drive to speed up disk access.

 Although I'd love to see the developers update this app more frequently with new features, it still works great for me in Windows 11\. You can also use it on Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.

 If the Piriform company sounds familiar, you may already be familiar with their very popular free[CCleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/ccleaner-review-2625143) (system cleaning) or[Recuva](https://www.lifewire.com/recuva-review-2622892) (data recovery) software.

## [Auslogics Disk Defrag](https://www.auslogics.com/en/software/disk-defrag/)

![Auslogics Disk Defrag v10 in Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HJ-rjKb7XPxOvTdflqEazjJbw2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/auslogics-disk-defrag-013fecab616b4d37a05e278d6f74a7e7.png)

 What We Like

* Free for personal and commercial use
* Updates often
* Files and folders can be excluded from a defrag
* Important system files can be moved to the faster part of the drive
* Lets you disable the ads

 What We Don't Like

* Boot-time defrags aren't available for free
* Unable to move custom files to the end of the hard drive
* Tries to install several unrelated programs during setup
* Scheduling isn't free

 With Auslogics Disk Defrag,[system files](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-system-file-2626015) , which are normally commonly used files, can be configured to be moved to faster areas of a disk to improve launch times and general system performance.

 That's a useful feature that not all of these other programs support, so if you want that, this is a good choice.

 But, know that there are some cons. The biggest one for me is that it doesn't support scheduled defrags. Also, although their website doesn't mention this, defragging during a reboot is locked for free users, too, and accessible only after paying for the Pro version.

 This program can also be used to check the drive for errors with [chkdsk](https://www.lifewire.com/chkdsk-command-2625838) and exclude files/folders from a defrag.

 It's officially supported on Windows 11, 10, 8, and 7.

## [WinContig](https://www.mdtzone.it/sw/wincontig/en/index.html)

![WinContig list of fragmented files](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DrK2sgI5mIL8t5_bpRF7Fb_n4Js=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/wincontig-fragmented-files-list-00ba6e2227fc44cbbcc731de148be02a.png)

 What We Like

* No installation necessary
* Defrag specific files and folders only
* Free for personal and commercial use
* Optional command-line switches

 What We Don't Like

* Lots of options can feel overwhelming

 WinContig describes itself as the "perfect tool to defragment particular files that are frequently used and continuously becoming fragmented." This means it's unique among most of these other defrag utilities because it's built specifically for defragmenting particular files instead of a whole drive.

 Since this program specializes in improving the loading speed of things like program files, it also includes the ability to specify a disk zone to place specified files and folders. For example, you can move frequently used files to the fast access zone to hopefully speed up access to those files.

 After a fragmentation analysis, you'll see a list of all the files that contain fragments, as well as each file's fragmentation percentage. An exclusions list is available as well if you want to prevent some data from being relocated. You can also use WinContig to check for disk errors.

 I like this program for its ability to quickly defrag just a few things, but I didn't find it as user-friendly as some of these higher-ranked options. Another thing: I couldn't validate how helpful the disk zone feature really is.

 My tests were performed in Windows 11, but the program is also compatible with Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista.

## [Disk Defragmenter](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-defrag-your-computer-3506876)

![Screenshot of Disk Defragmenter in Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0h4EGCSnVxS3PBnxQSwq8MBvvao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/windows-disk-defragmenter-5995a83603f40200111eec36.png)

Disk Defragmenter.

 What We Like

* Built-in to Windows; no installation necessary
* Easy to use
* Can run defrags on a schedule
* Defrags internal and external drives

 What We Don't Like

* Can't defragment locked files (i.e., no boot time defrag option)
* Finding the program is different depending on your version of Windows

 Disk Defragmenter already exists in Windows, which means[you just have to open it to use it](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-defrag-your-computer-3506876) . You can set schedules and defragment both internal and external hard drives.

 Many of the other defrag programs from this list have many advantages over this one, such as boot time defrags and optimization features. However, Microsoft's program is still definitely useful and has the added benefit of being usable_right now_ without having to download and install something.

 To find it, search your computer for**defrag** , or execute the**dfrgui** command from the Run dialog box.

[PageDefrag](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/pagedefrag.html) is a program developed by Microsoft's[Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) that can defragment your paging files and registry hives.

 What We Like

* Lots of defrag settings that you can tweak
* Can defrag when the computer idles
* Exclusions can be set up so as to not be defragged
* Defrags can be run while the computer is starting up
* Files you don't use often can be moved to the slower parts of the disk
* Lets you set up a defragmenting schedule

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't integrate itself into Explorer to make it easier to defrag files/folders
* Might try to install another program during setup

 Disk SpeedUp can defrag not only whole hard drives but also individual files and folders. Right off the bat, one thing I liked about using this program is that I could run an automatic defrag when my PC became idle for a particular amount of time.

 This program has very specific settings. For example, you can disable defrags if files have fragments that are smaller than 10 MB, have more than three fragments, and are larger than 150 MB. All of these values can be customized.

 You can also configure this tool to automatically move large, unused, and/or files of a certain format to the end of the drive so the commonly used, smaller ones end up toward the_beginning_ , hopefully improving access times. This is super smart, but I didn't necessarily notice performance gains after doing this, although your experience could be different.

 In addition to the above, Disk SpeedUp can exclude files and folders from a whole system defrag, run a boot time defrag, turn off the computer when a defrag has completed, and run defrags/optimizations on one or more drives on a daily/weekly/monthly schedule.

 This program was designed for Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP

[Download Disk SpeedUp](https://www.glarysoft.com/disk-speedup/download/)

 Disk SpeedUp might try to install other Glarysoft programs during setup, but you can easily uncheck anything you don't want.

Wise Care 365.

 What We Like

* Supports optimizing and defragmenting the drive
* Lets you enable an automatic shutdown for when the defrag finishes
* There's a portable option
* Includes other programs you might like

 What We Don't Like

* Can't defrag on a schedule
* There are_lot_ s of other programs in addition to the defrag tool
* Won't defragment locked files

[Our Review of Wise Care 365](https://www.lifewire.com/wise-care-365-review-2625184)

 Wise Care 365 is a collection of system utilities that scans for privacy issues and junk files. One of the tools, in the **System Tuneup** tab, is used for defragmenting a hard drive.

 Select the drive to defragment and then choose**Defragment** _,_ **Full Optimization** or**Analyze** . You can optionally shut down the computer after the defrag has finished.

 Scheduling defrags is_not_ supported in this program. Something else I don't like is the advertisement about the full version that's always displayed in the program. Also, some features and options are only available in the professional edition.

 If you don't like to use these types of programs that stuff dozens of mini tools into one download, then you'll want to pass on this one. If you read my review linked above, you'll see a comprehensive list of all the other tools that are included in this suite. I've used Wise Care 365 a number of times over the years, and it can be fun to play around with everything it has to offer, but it's absolutely overkill if all you want is a good defrag program.

 Wise Care 365 can be installed on Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. A portable version is available, too, but you have to 'make' it from within the installable version (more on this in the review).

Puran Defrag. © Puran Software

 What We Like

* Can defrag when the computer is idle
* Able to move commonly used files to the faster part of the hard drive
* Supports scheduled defrags
* Includes an option to run a defrag during boot up
* Defragmenting can start from the file/folder level
* Can also check the HDD for errors

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't show all the fragmented files (only the top 10)
* There isn't a portable option
* Setup might attempt to install another program
* The results after analyzing the drive are hard to read
* Free space defrags can't be run manually (only scheduled)
* Infrequent program updates

 Puran Defrag features a custom optimizer called Puran Intelligent Optimizer (PIOZR) to intelligently move common files to the outer edge of a disk to speed up access to those files.

 Like some of the other programs from this list, this one can defrag files and folders from File Explorer's right-click context menu, delete custom files/folders before a defrag is launched, and run boot time defrags.

 Something I like about this program is the freedom it provides. For example, there are very specific scheduling options available, like running an automatic defrag every so many hours, when the system goes idle, or when the screensaver starts.

 Similarly, particular schedules can be set up for boot time defrags like running it on the first computer boot up of the day, on the first of the week, or the first time your computer boots up every month.

 One thing I didn't like during my tests was that during setup, it tried to install additional programs I didn't need or want. Unfortunately, this is a common practice that I see a lot when installing software._Fortunately_ , it was easy to just skip those offers.

 It's said to be compatible with Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, and Windows Server 2008 and 2003\. I used it in Windows 10 without any issues.

Toolwiz SmartDefrag. © ToolWiz Software

 What We Like

* Very simple and easy-to-use interface
* Shows how many files are fragmented
* Moves archives to the slower parts of the drive to speed up access to other files

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't support scheduled defrags
* Doesn't show the level of fragmentation on the whole drive
* Can't customize anything
* Might not work for you in Windows 11/10

 If you're looking for a program that's super simple to use and isn't bogged down with confusing settings or buttons, then this is perfect.

 Toolwiz Smart Defrag is a small program that installs quickly and has a spotless, minimal interface. It claims to be 10 times quicker than the default defrag tool included in Windows and can place archive files to a different part of the drive to speed up access to regular files.

 You're able to see the number of fragmented files from an analysis and run a defrag really quickly, but you can't see the level of fragmentation that exists on a drive, nor can you schedule defragments to run at a later date.

 I think it's nice to have a program that isn't packed full of buttons and other toolbars, but it's also sometimes unfortunate. For instance, there are_zero_ customizable features.

 This program officially works in Windows 7, Vista, and XP. I used it just fine in Windows 8 as well.

 What We Like

* Advanced options hidden away for beginners
* Can check a hard drive for errors
* Defrags both internal and external hard drives
* Lets you defragment individual files and folders, not just entire HDDs

 What We Don't Like

* Advanced changes require you to edit a configuration file
* Scheduled defrags are hard to turn on
* Infrequent updates

 UltraDefrag can be used for novice and advanced users alike — there are common features that everyone can use, but also advanced options if you need to make specific changes to the program.

 Common functions like repairing, defragging, and optimizing drives are as simple to trigger as any of these other programs. However, if you wish to make_changes_ to the program in general or to the boot time defrag option, you have to know how to maneuver around a[BAT file](https://www.lifewire.com/bat-file-2619796) .

 This is a neat program if you like to tinker with things, but if that doesn't describe you, I highly recommend the first couple of apps I detailed at the top of the list.

 It should run fine on Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.

* Defrags can run each time the screensaver comes on
* Scheduled defrags can be set to not run if fragmentation is too low
* The really large system restore point files are moved to slower parts of the disk to increase performance for other files
* Produces extremely detailed hard drive reports

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't work with Windows 11, 10, or 8
* Some features are not free to use, so you'll be prompted to buy the full version
* Doesn't let you exclude files from defragmentation
* Can't defragment removable hard drives
* Unable to defrag during boot up

 O&O Defrag Free Edition has an organized and easy to use interface. It supports common features found in similar defrag software, like optimizing a drive, viewing a list of all the fragmented files, and checking a drive for errors.

 In addition to scheduling defrags on a weekly basis, you can also configure the program to start a defrag automatically when the screensaver comes on.

 You can optionally run through a_Quick configuration_ wizard to easily set up scheduling or immediately optimize a drive.

 Some features are only available in the paid version, which means you'll sometimes try to enable a setting only to be told you can't because you're using the free version, which can get irritating.

 O&O Defrag Free Edition is compatible with Windows 7, Vista, and XP. I tested the most recent version in newer editions of Windows, but I couldn't get it up and running.

 What We Like

* Includes plenty of advanced options
* Works "out of the box" for people who don't want to customize anything
* The interface is really simple and to the point
* Able to defrag removable drives and internal ones

 What We Don't Like

* Can be much harder to use than similar programs
* Doesn't work from File Explorer
* Last updated in 2010

 MyDefrag (formerly JkDefrag) can be both a simple and a rather complex defrag program, depending on your needs.

 It works by loading and running scripts on one or more drives. Several scripts are included when you first install it, like to defrag on a schedule, analyze a drive, and consolidate free space. The default install is just fine for regular users.

 More advanced users can build their own custom scripts, which can actually be very detailed to deeply customize the way MyDefrag works. Information about creating scripts can be found in the online manual.

 MyDefrag hasn't been updated since 2010, so it only officially supports Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, Server 2008, and Server 2003\. However, it still works with newer versions of Windows, like Windows 11, 10, and 8.

## Do I Need a Defrag Program?

 If you don't already know,[defrag software programs can arrange the bits of data](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fragmentation-defragmentation-2625884) that make up the files on your computer so they're stored closer together. This allows your hard drive to access files more quickly. In some situations, running a defrag tool is a[solution for a slow computer](https://www.lifewire.com/why-is-my-computer-so-slow-5093810) . However, while one of these apps can help out if your computer uses a traditional hard drive, you don't need one if you have a[solid-state drive (SSD)](https://www.lifewire.com/solid-state-drive-833448) .
