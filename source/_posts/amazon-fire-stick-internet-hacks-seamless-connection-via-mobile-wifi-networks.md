Sherwin Williams/Apple

 What We Like

* Create custom color palette.
* Day-and-night lighting feature.
* Calculate how much paint you'll need.

 What We Don't Like

* The amount of paint options is a bit overwhelming.
* Only available for Android.

 This app not only allows you to explore all of Sherwin Williams' paint colors, ColorSnap also gives you the ability to create your own color palette. Choose a color you like and see coordinating colors and similar colors to take it to the next level.

 See the color you chose in living rooms, kitchens, and more, then take your app with you to a store to pick up your paint. Oh, and you won't have to guess how much you need; the app's paint calculator can do the math for you.
