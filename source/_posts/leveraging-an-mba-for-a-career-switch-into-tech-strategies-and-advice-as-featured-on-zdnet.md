## Leveraging an MBA for a Career Switch Into Tech: Strategies and Advice as Featured on ZDNet

You may not think of an MBA as a tech-related degree, but advanced business training can lead to several possible tech careers. Here, we explain how to get into tech after your MBA with the right choices and preparation.

According to the Graduate Management Admission Council's (GMAC) [2020 Corporate Recruiters Survey](https://www.gmac.com/-/media/files/gmac/research/employment-outlook/gmac%5Fcorporate%5Frecruiters%5Fsurvey%5Fsept%5F2020.pdf), the technology industry is one of the three largest employers of MBA graduates. 

In 2020, approximately 83% of tech employers expressed confidence that MBA graduates' skills would make them successful employees.

## Transferable skills from an MBA to tech

While certain [MBA concentrations](https://www.zdnet.com/education/business-management/mba-concentrations/) lend themselves better to tech, such as an [information systems MBA](https://www.zdnet.com/education/mba/mba-information-systems/), most MBA graduates possess useful skills for a tech career. MBA students receive leadership training, data-driven technology expertise, and extensive business operations knowledge.

Graduates also develop and hone applicable people skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. The [GMAC survey](https://www.gmac.com/-/media/files/gmac/research/employment-outlook/gmac%5Fcorporate%5Frecruiters%5Fsurvey%5Fsept%5F2020.pdf) found that employers value MBA graduates' communication skills, versatile skillsets, and strategic thinking most highly.

## Tips for how to get into tech after an MBA

Your preparation for the tech field should begin before you complete your degree. The following tips can help position you to make the most of your training and appeal to tech employers.

### 1\. Get clear on the type of tech role you want.

You can find tech careers in most industries these days, so you need to think about where you want to land. Think about your ideal company size and stage of development. That may influence the training, experience, and skills you emphasize in your professional development.

You might also settle on a preferred company by considering what industry you want, the work-life balance you need, and your desired salary and responsibilities.

### 2\. Upskill

Even after you get into a [top MBA program](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-get-into-top-mba-programs/) and graduate, [information technology careers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-careers-in-information-technology/) may require you to build specific technology skills. Expand your skillset by pursuing professional experience via internships or practicums. You can also continue your training in a specialized tech program, such as a [coding bootcamp](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-coding-bootcamps-guide/). Demonstrate your skills by earning [information technology certifications](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tech-certifications/).

In certain organizations and high-level positions, such as C-level management consultant roles, candidates may need a DBA or an advanced technology degree to qualify.

### 3\. Maximize the quality of your application and portfolio.

Highlight what makes you, your training, and your experience special. Focus on your advanced education in leadership, communication, networking, and strategic thinking. Use your cover letter to give specific examples and experiences applying these skills.

Though not all roles require a portfolio as part of the application, they're more common among tech roles. MBA students with coding experience should learn [how to build a coding portfolio](https://www.zdnet.com/education/how-to-build-a-coding-portfolio/). Use practical examples that highlight your skills' versatility. You can build your own portfolio webpage or use an existing online portfolio platform.

### 4\. Show your expertise, self-awareness, and passion throughout the interview process.

Tech interviews can look quite different from traditional business interviews. Employers must assess specific tech skills needed for the role. 

The process begins with a phone or online screener that gauges the applicant's interest and qualifications. 

The second interview usually involves a coding or technical assignment to assess the applicant's abilities. The final interview is typically in person and may involve technical challenges that candidates need to complete under supervision.

For more information, check out these [phone interview tips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/interview-tips-recent-grads/).
