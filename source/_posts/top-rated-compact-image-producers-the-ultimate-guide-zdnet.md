## Top-Rated Compact Image Producers : The Ultimate Guide - ZDNet

We've come a long way from the days when [Polaroids](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-instant-camera/) were your only option for printing photos in a matter of seconds. Now, we've got portable photo printers that can capture our favorite moments in vivid ink from anywhere, without the Polaroid's signature, washed-out flash (however cool the retro aesthetic may be). 

Aside from photos, portable printers are a compact general printing solution, as you can access important documents and PowerPoint decks on [business trips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-are-my-5-must-have-devices-for-work-travel-now/) or while [working remotely](https://www.zdnet.com/article/four-ways-to-secure-your-remote-work-setup/).
