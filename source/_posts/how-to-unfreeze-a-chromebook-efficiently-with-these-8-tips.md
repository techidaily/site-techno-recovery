## How Do I Use Gemini AI?

 Gemini relies on[generative AI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-generative-ai-7510795) to take your natural language queries and turn them into detailed answers. You can start a conversation and get any content, like text, images, music, language, 3D models, and more, with the help of a simple prompt.

1. In the Gemini chat window, begin typing your request in the**Enter your prompt here** field.  
![The prompt field in the Google Gemini web interface](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df8I0SZWORbiyM8-BLz2rxN2m8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Google-Gemini-prompt-field-94528b5550664e2f9c5c489c7ba2cd98.jpg)
2. As a multi-modal chatbot, you can speak to the chatbot, upload an image, write code, or ask it to process information from an online video.

5. Select the pencil icon next to your query to edit the original question, and then choose**Update** .

## Review Gemini's Answer With More Features

 You don't have to accept Gemini's original answer. The generative AI chatbot offers a few extra methods to change the style of the answer.  

1. Select**Show drafts** and view two more versions of the result. You can choose**Regenerate drafts** to force Gemini to make another attempt at better answers.  
![The "Hide/Show drafts" and "Regenerate drafts" options in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qA7gawJp3_oXG1w3DcDUr9ydFBE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Hide-drafts-and-regenerate-google-gemini-9cbbe551f2904f008b8c05bcf385caa5.jpg)
2. Give Gemini's large language model some feedback by choosing the**Good response** or**Bad response** icons (the thumb icons).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. The**Modify response** filter pop-up helps you adjust the length, simplify the language, and change the tone of a response. Use this to tailor the answers for your intended audience or finetune them.  
![The "Modify response" option in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tM5Ik6bHqWlxMYpKv-VT30BTI2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Modify-response-in-Google-Gemini-c53c46000aea49879f6ad313767b5a33.jpg)
4. Instead of making Gemini rewrite the entire content, you can modify parts of the generated responses. Highlight any part of the text and select the**Modify selected text** icon.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Enter a fresh prompt in the Modify with a prompt field to describe how you want the selected text to change, and then press**Enter** . The other options of**Regenerate** ,**Shorter** ,**Longer** , and**Remove** are self-explanatory.  
![Google Gemini Modify selected text ](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ek4DwjpGOxgIqgqgg0yWUoHFeHo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleGemini-Modify-Answer-Content-34d76e37a88c42c9969dfd593be19c21.jpg)

5. Gemini can be error-prone. Select the**Google** button at the foot of the response to double-check the answers. The AI checks with a Google Search and highlights content similar to (Green highlight) or different (Orange highlight) from Gemini's statements.

![The Settings > Extensions options in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pccAkIep3BpKkhVuV-2YYAWwlYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Extensions-in-Google-Gemini-08e89dd23f4940048feb9db7f2cf1f17.jpg)
