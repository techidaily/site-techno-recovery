## How Do I Use Gemini AI?

 Gemini relies on[generative AI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-generative-ai-7510795) to take your natural language queries and turn them into detailed answers. You can start a conversation and get any content, like text, images, music, language, 3D models, and more, with the help of a simple prompt.

1. In the Gemini chat window, begin typing your request in the**Enter your prompt here** field.  
![The prompt field in the Google Gemini web interface](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df8I0SZWORbiyM8-BLz2rxN2m8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Google-Gemini-prompt-field-94528b5550664e2f9c5c489c7ba2cd98.jpg)

## Review Gemini's Answer With More Features

 You don't have to accept Gemini's original answer. The generative AI chatbot offers a few extra methods to change the style of the answer.  

1. Select**Show drafts** and view two more versions of the result. You can choose**Regenerate drafts** to force Gemini to make another attempt at better answers.  
![The "Hide/Show drafts" and "Regenerate drafts" options in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qA7gawJp3_oXG1w3DcDUr9ydFBE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Hide-drafts-and-regenerate-google-gemini-9cbbe551f2904f008b8c05bcf385caa5.jpg)
2. Give Gemini's large language model some feedback by choosing the**Good response** or**Bad response** icons (the thumb icons).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. The**Modify response** filter pop-up helps you adjust the length, simplify the language, and change the tone of a response. Use this to tailor the answers for your intended audience or finetune them.  
![The "Modify response" option in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tM5Ik6bHqWlxMYpKv-VT30BTI2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Modify-response-in-Google-Gemini-c53c46000aea49879f6ad313767b5a33.jpg)
4. Instead of making Gemini rewrite the entire content, you can modify parts of the generated responses. Highlight any part of the text and select the**Modify selected text** icon.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Enter a fresh prompt in the Modify with a prompt field to describe how you want the selected text to change, and then press**Enter** . The other options of**Regenerate** ,**Shorter** ,**Longer** , and**Remove** are self-explanatory.  
![Google Gemini Modify selected text ](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ek4DwjpGOxgIqgqgg0yWUoHFeHo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleGemini-Modify-Answer-Content-34d76e37a88c42c9969dfd593be19c21.jpg)

5. Gemini can be error-prone. Select the**Google** button at the foot of the response to double-check the answers. The AI checks with a Google Search and highlights content similar to (Green highlight) or different (Orange highlight) from Gemini's statements.
