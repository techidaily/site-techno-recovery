As [artificial intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) (AI) carves more pathways to improve students' overall performance in the classroom, students can now further equip themselves outside the classroom using Gemini.

To help students get started, Google rounded up five [Gemini features](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-learning-features/) that students 18 years and older can start using today. 

## **1\. Access academic textbooks**

In partnership with [OpenStax](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-gemini-education-three-ways-google-is-equipping-students-and-education-with-ai/), a nonprofit initiative out of Rice University, Gemini can access all of the academic textbooks and educational materials in OpenStax's library. 

To activate OpenStax within Gemini, users can type in a prompt such as "@OpenStax explain \[insert subject here\]?"Then, the responses will reference OpenStax's content library, including concise explanations with links referencing the textbook content. 

## **2\. Create engaging quizzes to test your knowledge**

Gemini can help you test your knowledge of various subject matters by providing you with practice quizzes. Gemini can walk you through each question and provide feedback and hints to help you get through the quiz. 

**Also: [4 ways my favorite study app Quizlet just got even better (and it's still free)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/4-ways-my-favorite-study-app-quizlet-just-got-even-better-and-its-still-free/)**

All you have to do is type, "quiz me on \[insert subject here\]," and Gemini will deliver interactive quizzes and collaborative responses on topics ranging from the biological sciences to history and even pop culture.

## **3\. Upload educational content and materials to prep for exams**

Gemini Advanced users can upload up to ten documents of learning materials at a time, such as a class syllabus or notes, and you can ask Gemini to explain the material or create custom study guides from it. Gemini can also analyze your materials to summarize key concepts, provide relevant practice questions, and more.

Gemini Advanced is Google's Premium AI tier that is accessible via the [Google One AI Premium,](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj97o-Jjp2IAxW4W0cBHSssG7oYABAAGgJxdQ&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjw28W2BhC7ARIsAPerrcIdaYxT72vdOQOYmiejUkRz9gjQsZFeX9KpuxeJtoXicOrZ8cQaxfEaAuBDEALw%5FwcB&sig=AOD64%5F0Gp%5FvFm8fEQXlXTrx0jeIsxHT%5FOg&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwj3-oiJjp2IAxVkKFkFHQMnCb8Q0Qx6BAgKEAE) which costs $20 per month. Other perks of the plan include access to Google's most capable AI models and 2 TB of storage.

## **4\. Use the Learning Coach Gem for study help**

Gemini Advanced subscribers also have access to [Gems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-gemini-just-got-two-popular-chatgpt-plus-features-and-one-is-free-to-use/), which are customized versions of Gemini for tackling particular tasks. In addition to creating their own custom Gems, users can access the premade [Gem Learning coach](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/#link={) to help them create a tailored learning plan for their specific academic needs.

**Also: [Google's Gemini just got two popular ChatGPT Plus features - and one is free to use](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-gemini-just-got-two-popular-chatgpt-plus-features-and-one-is-free-to-use/)**

For example, if you want to prepare for upcoming exams, you can use the Learning Coach Gem and specify what you need to study and review. Then, the Learning Coach would create a learning plan that covers key subtopics and outlines essential topics. 

## **5\. Gain a better understanding of a topic** 

Gemini can simplify any topic in a digestible way by using videos, images, and real-life examples that demonstrate what you're learning. All you have to do is ask Gemini to provide you with an explanation or more resources on a specific topic. For example, you can ask Gemini for follow-up questions, video recommendations, and more. 

## Who can access it?

These Gemini features are only available for students 18 and older. School admins who manage [Google Workspace for Education](https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL%5Fus/workspace-for-education/editions/overview/) in their schools can turn access to Gemini on or off for educators and students.
