## How to Fix D3dx9\_39.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download the[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) from a "DLL download" site. There are a number of reasons[why downloading DLLs like that is almost always a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, delete the file immediately and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the "not found" error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD.  
 Usually, if a game or another program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy on the installation disc. Sometimes, though not often, this version is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.  
 The DirectX program you're looking for might be named_dxsetup_ or something similar. One quick way to find it is to search with a tool like [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) .
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_39.dll and a reinstallation could do the trick.  
 Sometimes, even after an uninstallation, files are left over that could still be causing issues that ultimately show an error message. Try a[free uninstaller tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188) instead so that you can be sure that the entire program, and all of its related files, are deleted before reinstalling it.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_39.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX installation package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.
