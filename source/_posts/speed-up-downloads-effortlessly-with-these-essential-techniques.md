 Run Fortnite again to check if your FPS increases. If the FPS is still the same, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

### **Tip 2: Update your graphics driver**

 **You can also enjoy a better gaming experience if you update your graphics driver to the latest version** . Many Fortnite players have reported that the FPS in Fortnite improves after they update their graphics driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually**  – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with **your** **exact graphics card model** and **your version of Windows** .

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from **the manufacturer** . They‘re **all certified as safe and secure** .
