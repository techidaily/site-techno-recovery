## Turbocharge Your Windows 11 Updates – Expert Tips to Save Time and Frustration

Microsoft regularly releases update packages to fix bugs and add new features. While updates can improve the system stability and increase PC performance, the slowness of the Windows update process can be really frustrating.

 If you’re stuck on the update screen for hours and the percentage number on the screen isn’t increasing at all, chances are the update process is stuck. And Windows says specifically “Getting Windows ready. Don’t turn off your computer”, so you might wonder what you should do next.

### Can I Turn off My PC during Updates?

 Yes, you can restart your PC, and it should be safe in most cases. To turn off your computer or laptop, you can long-press the power button.

 Windows update requires time to complete, so let it finish if you can. But if you’ve been waiting for an hour or so, then it’s probably stuck and there’s nothing else you can do.

 While in most cases, a hard shutdown during the update process didn’t cause issues. There are no guarantees that it also works for you. Unfortunately, it’s the only method to try if your computer gets stuck there.

### After restarting your PC, try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

### Fix 5: Update your device drivers

 Outdated or faulty hardware drivers can also trigger PC issues. To keep your computer running smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct drivers at all times.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your hardware: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for each of your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
