## How to Fix Ieframe.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed to try the simpler solutions first:

 Do not, under any circumstances, download the ieframe.dll DLL file individually from any DLL download site. There are many reasons why[downloading DLLs like that is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, remove it from wherever you placed it and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't already. The ieframe.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Update to the latest version of Internet Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-internet-explorer-2617983) . No matter if you're missing ieframe.dll or if you're receiving a browser error message about it, reinstalling or updating to the latest version of Internet Explorer has resolved many users' issues with this DLL file.
3. If you're using Visual Basic, change the reference for_Microsoft Internet Controls_ from the existing_ieframe.dll_ to_shdocvw.ocx_ . Save your project and then reopen it.
4. [Restart your router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) , switch, modem and anything else that's used to communicate to the internet or other computers on your network. There may be an issue in one of these pieces of[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) that a simple restart could solve.
5. [Scan your entire computer for viruses](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Sometimes, the ieframe.dll error will show up when your computer is infected with certain kinds of viruses.  
 It's not a bad idea to get a second opinion, even if you've been running[always-on AV software](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-antivirus-software-4151895) all this time and it never caught anything. There are[on-demand virus scanners](https://www.lifewire.com/free-on-demand-virus-scanners-1356635) that are good for that sort of thing.
6. [Disable Windows Firewall](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-disable-the-windows-firewall-2624505) if you have another firewall installed. Running two firewall applications at the same time can cause problems.  
 Even if you're positive that the Windows firewall is disabled, check again. Some Microsoft security updates have been known to re-enable the firewall automatically, even if you have an existing firewall enabled in another security software program.
7. Update all non-Microsoft firewall and other security software on your computer. Certain security updates from Microsoft have been known to cause issues with security software from other vendors that those vendors are responsible for resolving. Check their websites for updates or[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and install any that are available.  
 If you're already running a fully updated version of your security software, try[uninstalling and then reinstalling the software](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) instead. A clean installation may stop that nagging ieframe.dll error message.
8. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . It is true that some previous updates from Microsoft may actually_cause_ some ieframe.dll errors, but installing more recent updates, especially those to the Windows Update software itself, might help resolve the problem.
9. [Clear the temporary Internet files in Internet Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-the-cache-in-internet-explorer-2624707) . Some ieframe.dll issues might have to do with problems accessing existing temporary internet files.
10. Increase the frequency that Internet Explorer checks for new versions of web pages. If the default setting is too infrequent and there are issues with certain pages, you might see ieframe.dll and related errors.  
 Open**inetcpl.cpl** from the Run dialog box (**WIN+R** ) and select**Settings** in the_Browsing history_ section of the**General** tab. Pick**Every time I visit the webpage** if you're not sure what to choose.

11. [Disable Internet Explorer add-ons one by one](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-selectively-disable-internet-explorer-add-ons-2624491) . One of your installed add-ons might be causing the ieframe.dll issue. Selectively disabling them will show you which one, if any, is causing problems.
12. [Set Internet Explorer security options back to their default levels](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-internet-explorer-security-settings-to-default-levels-2624499) . Some programs, even some updates from Microsoft, will sometimes make automatic changes to your Internet Explorer security settings.  
 Incorrect or overprotective security settings can sometimes cause ieframe.dll issues. Returning these settings to their default levels might correct your issue.
13. [Move the IE Temporary Internet Files Folder to its default location](https://www.lifewire.com/move-ie-temporary-internet-files-folder-to-its-default-location-2624500) . If this folder has been moved from its original location, plus both Protected Mode and the Phishing Filter are enabled, the ieframe.dll error will occur.
14. [Disable the Phishing Filter in Internet Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-disable-the-phishing-filter-in-internet-explorer-2624504) . This isn't a great long-term solution if you don't have another phishing filter installed, but doing so has been known to correct ieframe.dll issues in some situations.
15. [Disable Protected Mode in Internet Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-disable-protected-mode-in-internet-explorer-2624507) . The Protected Mode feature can, in some very specific situations, be involved in generating an ieframe.dll error message.

![Ieframe.dll Error](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hTMTm1JjQIk0Gm86WdscTXjUKZ4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ieframe-dll-error-message-59667cff3df78c160ee73289.PNG)

 The ieframe.dll file is related to Internet Explorer. In many cases, the installation of IE causes ieframe.dll errors to appear. This[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) error message applies to the browser on any of Microsoft's operating systems that support any version of the program, including Windows 10 through Windows XP.

 In addition to the installation of Internet Explorer, other causes include viruses, certain[Windows Updates](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) , incorrect firewall settings, outdated security software applications, and more.

 Ieframe.dll errors are fairly varied and really depend on the cause of the problem. Here are a few of the more common errors related to this file:

* **Res://ieframe.dll/dnserror.htm#**
* **File Not Found C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\IEFRAME.DLL**
* **Cannot find the file ieframe.dll**
* **C:\\Windows\\System32\\ieframe.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.**

 Most ieframe.dll "not found" or "missing" type of errors occur when using Internet Explorer or while using Visual Basic.

 The "Res://ieframe.dll/dnserror.htm" and related messages are much more common and appear in the browser window itself.
