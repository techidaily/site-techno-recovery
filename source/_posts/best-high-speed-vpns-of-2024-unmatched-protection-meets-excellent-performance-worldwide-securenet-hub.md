## Best High-Speed VPNs of 2024: Unmatched Protection Meets Excellent Performance Worldwide | SecureNet Hub

One question about VPNs I often encounter as a VPN reviewer is, which is the fastest VPN in the world? Though I have [extensively tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/), researched, and written about VPNs, there's still no conclusive answer. A VPN can be relatively fast in one instance and slow in another, mainly influenced by factors like the encryption process, server load and distance, time of day, app configurations and settings, and more.

If you're looking for the fastest VPN for browsing, remote work, streaming, gaming, or torrenting, we've run the speed tests and selected the best-performing services to help you out. 

## What is the fastest VPN right now?

Our pick for the fastest VPN overall is NordVPN, following speed tests in many locations. It works seamlessly on commonly-used devices like laptops and phones, with a rapidly growing global server fleet that makes it easier to find reliable servers in or near any location. The app updates very frequently, which can be annoying, but this is expected of such an elite service packed with many secure features.

### NordVPN

#### Fastest VPN overall

NordVPN outshone rivals when we tested server connections in many regions, primarily North America and Europe. With an average 89% speed retention (11% reduction), it registered the least speed drops from the baseline 250Mbps internet connection. This great performance is partly due to the NordLynx protocol, an optimized version of the renowned WireGuard protocol used in most fast VPNs.

The extensive network of 6,400+ servers in 111 countries is another reason NordVPN tops the list of the fastest VPNs. You can easily find secure and fast servers in many more locations than what most competition offers. There are also specialty servers like double VPN, Onion over VPN, and obfuscated servers to facilitate smooth online activities. NordVPN is compatible with popular devices and platforms too, making it ZDNET's pick for the [best VPN overall](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) and the [best VPN for iPhone and iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-iphone-and-ipad/).

### ExpressVPN

#### Fastest VPN for streaming and gaming

ExpressVPN is our second-best speed VPN, ideal for bandwidth-consuming activities like 4K streaming and gaming online. It came close to NordVPN, dropping 15% from base speeds, but did slightly better on distant server locations like Australia and Japan. The upload and download speeds remained consistently fast, supporting gaming without lag.

All ExpressVPN servers are obfuscated, camouflaging your VPN traffic as a regular internet connection. This makes it useful for bypassing geo-blocks on websites and platforms anywhere. It's also hard for your ISP to throttle (or deliberately slow down) your connections if you're consuming a lot of bandwidth, say while playing Valorant online with friends. That said, ExpressVPN is quite expensive, and may not be your best choice if you're on a tight budget.

### Proton VPN

#### Fastest VPN for torrenting

Proton VPN is tailored for high-end privacy, with many features to secure your peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing traffic. Within its server fleet across 110+ countries, there are torrenting-optimized servers, as well as Secure Core servers. The latter redirects your P2P traffic through privacy-friendly countries, like Switzerland, avoiding data retention. The VPN's NetShield feature is every torrenter's dream, blocking ads, trackers, and malware from loading whenever you open risky sites. 

At peak speeds, Proton VPN reached 230Mbps, though some servers went below 200Mbps (a 20% drop). Besides offering the fast WireGuard protocol, the app has a built-in VPN Accelerator feature to boost connection speeds on your device. Its P2P servers also support port forwarding, a feature that significantly helps to improve download speeds when torrenting.

### Surfshark

#### Fastest VPN with unlimited device connections

Surfshark is a top-spot contender that supports unlimited simultaneous devices. Just like NordVPN and ExpressVPN, it delivers speedy connections. I averaged 23% speed loss on different servers, but it was great that all my devices were secured with just one account. An auto-connect button on the app automatically selects the fastest server for you (based on your location), but you can also choose manually from a network of over 3,200 servers in 100+ countries.

User-friendliness and affordability are other key features Surfshark offers. Subscriptions start from as low as $2.19/month, but you only enjoy the low-cost advantage if you purchase the extended plans. Surfshark also has strong secure features, including AES-256-bit encryption with perfect forward secrecy (PFS).

Jurisdiction  United States

Price  $40 per year or $12 per month (3-year plans available at $79 every three years)

### Private Internet Access (PIA)

#### Fastest VPN for iPhone and iPad

The Private Internet Access VPN iOS app offers many custom settings, allowing you to adapt the VPN for optimal performance on iPhone and iPad. The encryption is set to 128-bit by default, which is faster than the 256-bit used by most VPNs, but you can easily switch to the latter for advanced protection. Also, PIA offers one of the largest server networks - over 29,000 servers in 91 countries (notably in all US states). You can find a secure server near or in your location for fast connections.

When using PIA on iOS, you can tunnel some apps and websites on the VPN and exclude others. This flexibility helps to enhance speed because all VPN resources are dedicated to the few apps connecting to the servers. PIA, like Surfshark, also supports unlimited connections at affordable prices, starting at $2.03/month.

Pros 
* Specialized servers
* Automatic kill switch
* RAM-only servers

Cons 
* Vague privacy policy

### CyberGhost

#### Fastest VPN for Android

Almost every VPN has a native app for [Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-vpn/), but I pick CyberGhost over other fast services we tested. CyberGhost is more or less in the same speed class as PIA, with over 70% average speed retention, but the app is convenient to use on Android. In high-traffic locations like the US, the VPN's servers support up to 10Gbps connections, so you can expect quick data transfers when using fast Wi-Fi networks, for example, to stream UHD content on Android TV.

In my [CyberGhost VPN review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyberghost-vpn-review/), Automatic Wi-Fi Protection was one of the most notable features of the app. It automatically secures your connections on unsecured Wi-Fi, like at a cafe or at work, even if you don't remember to turn on the VPN. If you experience slow connections with the VPN, enabling the app's MTU size feature can help enhance speeds.

**CyberGhost VPN features:** **Download speed:** 27% reduction | **Simultaneous connections:** Up to 7 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, routers, Apple TV, and more | **Logging:** No activity logs | **Countries:** 100 | **Trial/MBG** **:** 45 days

### Windscribe

#### Fastest free VPN

Secure, fast, and free are a difficult combination to find in a VPN service. Windscribe and Proton VPN are among our [best free recommendations](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) in most cases. Windscribe has free servers in over 10 countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada. Impressively, the free servers can access streaming platforms. I had a breeze with streaming HD content, with the servers retaining 65% (average) of the original internet speeds.

With a free Windscribe account, you can connect unlimited devices and even install an extension on Chrome browser. However, you only get up to 10GB of free bandwidth per month, which can easily support basic browsing. The paid service, starting at $5.75/month, unlocks more features, including servers in 69 countries and 134 cities.

**Windscribe VPN features: Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, FireTV | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** Online form, online FAQ only | **Data limit**: 2GB/10GB monthly | **Countries**: 69 | Browser extension available

### TunnelBear

#### Fastest user-friendly VPN

TunnelBear makes using a VPN easy and fun for beginners and those who are less tech-savvy. The apps are intuitive on PC and phone, with a server map layout where you can tap on a location and instantly connect. Technical features are also given friendly names like VigilantBear (kill switch), SplitBear (split tunneling), GhostBear (obfuscation), and so forth.

Server speed performance was above average, with base speed retention ranging from 70-80%. However, TunnelBear had the smallest server locations in only 47 countries. Coupled with its limited device support (only phone, PC, and browsers), we couldn't pitch it at the top of the list.

**TunnelBear VPN features: Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** Online form, online FAQ | **Data limit**: 2GB/month | **Countries**: 47

## Will a VPN make my internet connection faster?

A VPN may slow down your internet connection, but can, in some cases, result in faster speeds. If you want to use a secure VPN and maintain your fast internet connection, opt for a reputable service that's optimized for speed performance. Also, choose the nearest server location to shorten the distance your VPN traffic has to travel.

If your ISP (internet service provider) has capped speeds, leading to slower internet connections, then using a VPN can help to make the speeds faster. ISPs often do this if they see you're using up a lot of bandwidth, for example, when downloading large files or streaming in high quality. Masking your IP address and encrypting your traffic means they can't target or even see your activities, allowing you to browse at normal speeds.

## Why do VPNs slow down internet speed?

When connected to a VPN, your data and internet traffic travels longer distances, leading to slower speeds. It routes through the VPN servers before reaching the websites you want to visit (and vice versa for the return journey). Also, data is encrypted and decrypted in the tunneling process, leading to slower speeds than unencrypted connections. Sometimes, the servers get overcrowded with many users, affecting the transmission speeds. You can always try different servers if you're experiencing slow connections.

## What's the best fast VPN overall?

NordVPN tops our fastest VPN list because it had the best speed retention (minimal speed losses) after we averaged performance over short and long distances. The server coverage in 111 countries, reliable NordLynx protocol, and loads of security features, make it a well-balanced and fast VPN service.

## How we test VPNs

For this list of the fastest VPNs, we subjected 25+ reputable VPN services to a rigorous testing process. Each VPN's download speeds were recorded for over two days in 10 different server locations. The VPN protocols were set to automatic, allowing each VPN to choose the best protocol to use with a particular server. Before each test, we did a full factory reset on the testing device. Whenever possible, we connected to servers in the following countries, or the closest server if the specific country wasn't available:

* US (North America)
* Canada (North America)
* Mexico (North America)
* Brazil (South America)
* UK (Europe)
* Germany (Central Europe)
* Japan (East Asia)
* Netherlands (Western Europe)
* Singapore (Southeast Asia)
* Australia (Oceania)
* Turkey (Europe/Asia)

Before each test, we measured baseline download speeds to calculate the speed retention or loss when using a VPN. 

Ideally, if we ran these tests every month, we'd likely have a different order for the top 5 or 10 VPNs each time. But my best guess would be that the slowest VPNs would always be near the bottom and the fastest ones would consistently be near the top with this method.

For further information on our extensive testing process on VPNs, feel free to read our [testing methodology page](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/). 

## Factors to consider when choosing a fast VPN

Besides speeds, we also differentiated the fastest VPNs by checking essential features that help to enhance performance and overall user experience. We checked for:

* **Connection stability:** An ideal fast VPN sustains fast connections during peak and off-peak usage times.
* **Server network:** Extensive coverage minimizes server congestion, providing fast connections in many locations worldwide.
* **Security and privacy:** It's also crucial for a fast VPN to provide strong protection, integrating features like AES 256-bit encryption, kill switch, leak protection, and a trustworthy no-logs policy.
* **Multi-activity support:** Ranging from basic browsing to streaming, gaming, or torrenting, a reliable VPN should be able to do it all without major issues.
* **Compatibility:** All the selected VPNs are compatible with popular devices like PCs, phones, smart TVs, routers, consoles, and even streaming media players like Fire TV Stick and Roku.
* **User-friendliness:** Straightforward VPN apps with features such as auto-connect help you find the fastest servers in any location without hassle.
* **Value for money:** We weighed the cost-value proposal, selecting VPNs that deliver quality service for the right price.

## What is the fastest free VPN and is it safe?

Windscribe is a fast, free, and safe VPN offering servers in many countries. Proton VPN is a close alternative with unlimited bandwidth for streaming, downloading, and sharing as much content as you want. These two free apps do not have ads and operate no-logs policies, meaning they won't collect or share your information with third parties (like marketers).

## How do I optimize my VPN speed?

For faster VPN speeds, connect via fast protocols like WireGuard and IKEv2 (or a proprietary one if offered). When using the OpenVPN protocol, try switching to TCP, which performs better than DCP. If your VPN supports AES 128-bit encryption, use this instead of the more advanced AES 256-bit. Features like split tunneling allow you to tunnel only specific and necessary apps on the VPN, saving you bandwidth.

Also, connect to servers closest to you for faster speeds. Use optimized servers for activities like streaming, gaming, or torrenting, if your VPN offers them. Additional things you can do to speed up VPN connections include disabling antivirus and firewalls on your device as well as rebooting your router if connections are slow.

## Are VPN speed boosters a scam?

VPN speed boosters can't give you speeds beyond limits set by your ISP. They're only meant to improve efficiency in the VPN tunneling process so that you can get speeds almost as fast as your baseline connections. Therefore, you shouldn't expect VPN speed booster features to offer advantages over speed limitations set by your internet service.

## Surfshark vs NordVPN: Which VPN is fastest?

NordVPN is faster than Surfshark, especially when you use the in-house NordLynx protocol. It delivers better connections in several locations than Surfshark's WireGuard protocol. However, we didn't notice significant speed differences on OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec protocols over short and long distances. Both can reliably support smooth online streaming, gaming, and torrenting, and have custom settings to help you optimize speed performance.
