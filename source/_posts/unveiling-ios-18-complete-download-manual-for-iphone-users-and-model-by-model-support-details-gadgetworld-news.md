## Complete Guide: IPhone Models Supporting iOS 18 and Others That Don't - Insights

![Apple iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/07d7b2319988a064f8e64c2e08340ea87cf5db71/2024/09/09/ab1be8f2-2fbf-4e9e-99aa-826928546e58/dsc01906.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

The iPhone 16 lineup is spearheading iOS 18's AI features, but it's not the only device compatible with the latest software update.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Apple announced a string of [artificial intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) (AI) updates to its operating systems in one of its most jam-packed [WWDC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/) keynotes this summer. For the iPhone, Apple unveiled [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-the-biggest-iphone-changes-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024/), the latest iteration of its smartphone software that is now available [for download](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-ios-18-public-beta-on-iphone-right-now-heres-how-and-which-models-support-it/). The latest iOS includes enhanced AI integrations in Siri, [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) capabilities in [Photos](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-photos-app-is-getting-an-ai-powered-editing-feature-to-wipe-out-photobombers/) and [Messages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/) (which are still to come), and updates to its Health and [Calculator](https://www.zdnet.com/article/after-14-years-apple-expected-to-unveil-the-ipad-app-weve-all-been-waiting-for-at-wwdc/) apps.

Apple removes one or two older iPhone models from its list of supported devices each time it releases a new iOS version, marking the end of those devices' software support cycle. Most of the [newest AI features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-upcoming-ai-features-for-now/) are reserved for the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/) and the newer iPhone 16 models, as these features require the processing power of an A17 Pro chipset or later and 8GB of RAM or higher. However, iOS 18 is still available for many older models.

Notably, the once-popular iPhone X model is not on the list. Older devices like the iPhone 8 series also didn't make the cut this year.

## iOS 18 beta vs full release: What's the difference?

The iOS 18 beta version differs slightly from the general release. Beta testers are given a release that has recently exited its alpha phase, so problems and bugs are expected to arise. The purpose of the beta phase is to gather user feedback to repair these bugs and address any user interface issues before the software is massively distributed.

Beta versions can also be incomplete and not the final product, especially in the case of iOS 18, which didn't include [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-upcoming-ai-features-including-the-new-siri/) features in the initial beta release. This means the iOS 18 beta version is more prone to bugs, glitches, and instability.

**Also: [Is iOS 18 tanking your iPhone battery? Here's why, and what you can do](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-ios-18-tanking-your-iphone-battery-heres-why-and-what-you-can-do/)**

The general release will have ironed out most of these bugs and problems using the user feedback gathered during the beta phase, delivering more complete software that isn't as prone to bugs, though they still happen, as we saw with the [bugs in the iPhone Messages app](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-bug-can-cause-messages-app-to-crash-how-to-avoid-data-loss/).

One example of this process is when Apple released the iOS 17 beta version in 2023\. The early beta version featured the "End" button during a call that had moved from the center to the right, which was a big change for iPhone users. Disapproving feedback from beta testers resulted in [Apple moving the "End" button back to the center of the screen](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-moved-iphones-end-call-button-again-is-this-spot-less-weird/), where users had been accustomed to.

## When was iOS 18 released?

Apple typically releases its new operating systems for public beta access a few weeks after WWDC. iOS 18 was released in public beta in mid-July. The public beta program lets users test developing software to pinpoint bugs and performance issues. This process lets software teams make any necessary fixes and releases before the new system reaches general availability.

**Also: [Every iPhone model that will support Apple's upcoming AI features (including the new Siri)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-upcoming-ai-features-including-the-new-siri/)**

Apple released iOS 18 out of beta on September 16, a week after its ["Glowtime" event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/). The Apple Intelligence features will be available in stages for qualifying devices and are expected to roll out gradually over the coming months.

## What is a software beta?

A software beta is a version of a program or operating system initially released to a limited group of users to gather feedback and iron out bugs. The beta release lets a developer or company test its software program or system to emulate real-world use before a general release.

The beta phase follows alpha testing, where software is developed and tested internally within the company.

## Which iPhone models will get Apple Intelligence?

While many iPhone models support iOS 18, very few will support Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI features. Apple Intelligence is now available in a beta version for the iPhone 15 Pro series and iPhone 16 series, as well as iPads and Macs with an M1 chip or later. 

**Also: [iOS 18.1 public beta arrives with Apple Intelligence - how to try it now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-public-beta-arrives-with-apple-intelligence-how-to-try-it-now/)**

Apple Intelligence will be part of iOS 18, iPadOS18, and macOS Sequoia, but will be released over time.

## Which iPhone models will no longer be supported?

iOS 18 will not be supported in the iPhone X, iPhone 8, or earlier models. The new iOS version will only be available for iPhones sporting an A12 Bionic chip or newer.

## What should you do with your outdated iPhone?

The Apple brand is strong and holds significant resale value, so you can always sell your older iPhone and disclose that it's no longer supported for software updates. There's a lot of demand for older iPhones that are still functional and budget-friendly, but you can also trade them for credit towards a new device.

**Also: [The best iPhone models of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/)**

Apple, Best Buy, and Amazon are just some retailers that accept iPhone trade-ins. iPhones' resale and trade-in values depend heavily on their condition and storage capacity. Features like an intact screen and a working camera greatly influence resale or trade-in values.

If you're looking to maintain or obtain a service provider, you can check your iPhone's trade-in value at one of these retailers or at an authorized dealer for a telecommunications company.
