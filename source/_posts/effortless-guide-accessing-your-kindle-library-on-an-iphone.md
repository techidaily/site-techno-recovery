### Method 1: Read Kindle books on iPhone with Kindle app

How to read Kindle books on iPhone? Actually, Amazon has designed and offered the Kindle app for iPhone to help iPhone users read Kindle books on iPhone instead of Kindle device. You can download the Kindle app via [Amazon official website](https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/kcp-landing-page?ie=UTF8&ref%5F=kcp%5Fiphone%5Fmkt%5Flnd) or [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id302584613?mt=8). You can also directly download it via iTunes stores on your iPhone.

#### Step1: Download and install Kindle app for iPhone

Tap "App Store" icon on your iPhone, search for "Amazon Kindle for iPhone", download and install it.

#### Step2: Register Kindle app and sync purchased Kindle books

Once you have installed Kindle app on your iPhone, launch it and register it with your Amazon account. Then you will find all your purchased Kindle books from Amazon, click the eBooks you want to read and then they will be downloaded. With this Kindle app, you can also buy Kindle books on iPhone.

### Method 2: Read Kindle books on iPhone with iBooks

If you often purchase or download books from Amazon, it's not hard for you to find that most of Kindle books are DRM protected. This locks us can only read Kindle books on Kindle reading app and Kindle devices. What if we would like to read Kindle books with iBooks instead of Kindle app? Is there any effective solutions? Of course, the answer is yes. While there is a will, there is a way. But before that, we'd better figure out the restrictions between Kindle books and iBooks app. First, Kindle books are usually Kindle DRM protected, while iBooks uses Fairplay DRM; Second, iBooks supports EPUB or PDF common format, not including Kindle unique files, such as Mobi, AZW or AZW3\. So as long as we solve the 2 problems mentioned above, we can read Kindle books on iBooks freely.

#### Step 2: Convert Kindle books to EPUB/PDF format

As long as we have decrypted Kindle files, we can convert the format without limitations. Simply select EPUB or PDF as output format and click the blue "Convert" button on the bottom right corner to start conversion. After it has been finished, the output folder will pop up automatically, it shows all your converted Kindle files. Really convenient and friendly design, right?

#### Step 3: Transfer books to iPhone

Now what we have to do is only to transfer decrypted and converted files from computer to iPhone. To copy books to iPhone, we cannot directly transfer it via USB, we need another tool iTunes. 

1Launch iTunes on computer, click "File" in the menu bar and choose "Add File to Library...", add converted files.

2Connect iPhone to computer with USB, you can see you device on the upper right corner.

**3** Click on the device's name "iPhone", active the option "Sync Books".

4Tap "Sync" button on the bottom right corner to make sure all the books have been transferred to your iPhone.

Does this app still not work with the newer Kindle devices for decryption so they can be converted to another format for reading on a different device?

Hi,

 You mean use the program to directly remove DRM from Kindle files synced via Kindle device? 

 Currently this tool can decrypt books synced via Kindle eReader. You can simply connect it computer, launch the tool, then it will detect your Kindl eReader, simply drag the files from the right side to the left main interface to remove DRM.
