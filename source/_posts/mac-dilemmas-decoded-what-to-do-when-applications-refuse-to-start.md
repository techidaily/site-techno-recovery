 Everybody watches YouTube, but that isn't the only source of free, original, uploaded video content. Vimeo offers thousands of videos from many sources, including aspiring amateur filmmakers. The best way to get started is by checking out Vimeo's staff picks. Categories include music videos, short documentaries, comedy, and more.

## PLEX

![PLEX Media Player App](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yZVBdXAAOhVlGkIdBzVqrS2SjDs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/plex-samsung-apps-599356d9d088c00013d01190.jpg)

* View online web shows and podcasts.
* Upload your own movies, music, photos, and more.
* Easy-to-use interface.

 What We Don't Like

 PLEX provides a way to organize your content so it can be easily accessed on your Samsung smart TV. This allows you to play any compatible media content stored on your computer on your TV. You just have to make sure that you have the PLEX app installed on your TV and the PLEX media server software installed on your computer. You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

* Built-in rating system.
* Decent selection of free movies to watch.

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content. You can rent many movies for $4.99, usually with a 48-hour viewing window. Content offerings, some in HDR, change periodically. You need only a 4mbps to 5mbps broadband speed.

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more. You can also watch a lot of live news feeds from sources such as the LA Times, Bloomberg, and ABC News, as well as live gaming and some live sports.
