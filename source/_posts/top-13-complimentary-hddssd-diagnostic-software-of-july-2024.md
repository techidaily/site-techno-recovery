Fortunately, this color can be changed in the theme’s settings.

Microsoft

 What We Like

* Good mix of Halloween and autumn imagery.
* 13 images to choose from in the theme.

 What We Don't Like

* Some images look a bit blurry on high res monitors.

 Pumpkin Season is a Microsoft-made desktop theme that’s all about Halloween, autumn, and everything in between. The 13 photos in this theme feature everything one would expect from Jack-o-lanterns and candy to autumn leaves and pumpkin seeds. All of these images do have a high resolution but they aren’t 4K which means that some look a little blurry on high-end Windows devices such as Microsoft’s line of Surface computers and tablets. This minor issue will likely only bother those with an eye for resolution though such as photographers and designers.

Microsoft

 What We Like

* Good combo of Christmas food and decoration images.

 What We Don't Like

* The orange system color is an odd choice.

 Winter Holiday Glow is a theme that features nine Christmasy images. The high-resolution photos range from festive cookies and lights to pinecones in the snow and cinnamon sticks. The choice of orange as the system color is strange but this can be changed within the theme settings.

 What We Like

* A fun reinterpretation of the Windows logo.
* Not just overdone photos of Pride flags.

 What We Don't Like

* Would look better with a white or black system color.

 Pride 2020 Flags is a stylish theme that features 18 different colored variations of the Windows logo. This theme pack is a rather creative way to bring the colors of Pride to your device without resorting to the literal images of Pride and Progress flags which are so overdone during Pride celebrations. Don’t let the 2020 in the title dissuade you, this desktop theme is perfect every year.
