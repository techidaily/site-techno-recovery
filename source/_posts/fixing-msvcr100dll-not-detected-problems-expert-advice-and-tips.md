## Fixing ‘msvcr100.dll’ Not Detected Problems: Expert Advice and Tips
 Msvcr100.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the msvcr100[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, the errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 The msvcr100.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

![msvcr100 dll error message on Windows 11 desktop](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w_oqPVp30ZnUGSLDtJ8hwuFIQPw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/msvcr100-error-message-32faa1e26c8b4439ad7780f28b5297fd.png)

 Error messages like the ones listed below can occur while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation. Some possible reasons for the error are that the DLL file was deleted, the program that needs it can find it, or the file is corrupt.

 There are several ways msvcr100.dll errors can show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common errors you might see:

* **Msvcr100.dll Not Found**
* **The file msvcr100.dll is missing.**
* **The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer.**
* **This application failed to start because msvcr100.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\msvcr100.dll**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: msvcr100.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 Do not download msvcr100.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many[reasons why downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

## How to Fix Msvcr100.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.

1. [Download the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) and run it. This will replace/restore the msvcr100.dll with the most recent copy provided by Microsoft.  
 There are a few download options from Microsoft for this update, based on the version of Windows you have installed—x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit). Check out our advice on[how to determine if you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you're not sure what to choose.  
 Some users have had to_also_ install[Microsoft Build Tools 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/#microsoft-build-tools-2015-update-3) to fix the error. Applying these updates is almost always the solution to msvcr100.dll errors, so try your best to complete this step.
2. [Restore the DLL file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of the "msvcr100.dll is missing" error is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted it but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you might be able to[recover the file with a free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
 Undeleting msvcr100.dll is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some msvcr100.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file.  
 It's even possible the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) producing the missing msvcr100.dll error. If the error message occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling that program might help.
6. [Copy the msvcr100.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) from the_\\System32\\_ folder and paste it into the_\\SysWOW64\\_ folder. This works if you already have the DLL file in the 32-bit folder ([System32](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-32-4684415) ) but are having troubles with 64-bit programs accessing it.  
 The full paths of these folders are_C:\\Windows\\System32_ and_C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\_ . Just right-click and copy the DLL file from the first folder, and then paste it into the second.
7. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft-distributed DLL files on your computer. This DLL file could be included in one of those updates.
8. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause msvcr100.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
9. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
10. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair DLL related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. We've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
11. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the error, this should be your last course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
12. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any msvcr100.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware-related.

 FAQ

* What does the msvcr100.dll file do?  
 The msvcr100.dll file is tied to Visual C++ and is needed in order to run any software that was made using Microsoft's code compiler.
* What should I do if a specific program requires msvcr100.dll and reinstallation doesn't work?  
 Some games and applications may need to have a copy of msvcr100.dll in their own software directories. If reinstalling the program doesn't fix the issue, make note of the directory noted in the error message and copy msvcr100.dll from C:\\Windows\\System32 or C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ into the necessary software folder.
