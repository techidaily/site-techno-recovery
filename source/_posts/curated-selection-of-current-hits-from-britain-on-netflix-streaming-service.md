## [ Best Irish Comedy: Derry Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7120662/?ref%5F=fn%5Fal%5Ftt%5F1)

![Derry Girls promotional photo](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/g6bXZkk6JXLt6jnBH0Mr2ncIJzo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/derry-girls-8773589522b0456aa5afe793430b4a81.jpg) 

IMDB

* **IMDb rating** : 8.5/10
* **Genre:** Comedy
* **Starring** : Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan
* **Created By** : Lisa McGee
* **TV Rating** : TV-MA
* **Number of Seasons** : 3

 Some with Irish ancestors might have a bone to pick for putting this Irish show on a British TV list, especially given the subject matter, but we'll take the heat for a show this good and this funny.

 Set in Derry, Ireland, in the 1990s, just as "The Troubles" are coming to an end,_Derry Girls_ follows a group of friends and family trying to grow up and make their way through the normal teenage drama, oh, and the decades-long sectarian violence that ravaged Derry.

 Not the typical backdrop for a comedy, of course, but that makes it all the more effective. An excellent, hilarious show.

## [ Best Football Docuseries: Sunderland 'Til I Die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8914684/?ref%5F=fn%5Fal%5Ftt%5F1)

Craig Sugden

* **IMDb rating:**  8.1/10
* **Genre:** Documentary, Sport
* **Starring:** Sunderland F.C., George Honeyman, Aiden McGeady
* **TV Rating** : TV-MA
* **Number of Seasons** : 3

 No list of British TV would be complete without at least one look at the national sporting pastime.

 While Netflix's roster of footy shows is a little thin, this is an interesting look at Sunderland AFC, a team that's been relegated from the Premier League to a lesser division (the worst teams in the Premier League are penalized each year with expulsion, while the best teams in the lower league are promoted).

 Focused on the team and its relationship with its fans and city, this is a great look at the beautiful game and what it means in England.

* **Genre** : Comedy

 Before_Fleabag_ and the hot priest, before_Killing Eve_ and James Bond, Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote and starred in this one-season comedy/drama about a mismatched group of friends living in short-term apartments in a disused hospital.

 When Waller-Bridge's character Lulu joins the group, she upends the relationships of the residents, most notably her long-time friend, and sometime-crush, the already-engaged Anthony (played by Damien Molony).

 Funny, heartbreaking, and complex,_Crashing_ will satisfy_Fleabag_ fans looking for more of Waller-Bridge's unique voice.

 Sick of the cutthroat and toxic reality TV and competition shows that clutter the airways (and streaming services like Netflix)?_The Great British Baking Show_ (originally_The Great British Bakeoff_ in the UK) is the perfect palate cleanser.

 There's no more heart-warming competition show, in which everyone is nice to each other, participants often help struggling competitors, and roving comedians offer as much moral support as they do jokes.

 Each season takes competitors through a series of baking challenges, some focused on style and design, others on just baking something that tastes amazing, until a winner is crowned at the end of 10 episodes.

* **Starring** : Richard Armitage, Siobhan Finneran, Anthony Stewart Head
* **Created By** : Danny Brocklehurst
* **TV Rating** : TV-MA
* **Number of Seasons** : 1

 While it may be based on an American novel (Harlan Coben's 2015 book of the same name), transferring the story to Manchester makes this squarely a UK show.

 In it, suburban dad Adam (Armitage) is approached by a strange young woman who tells him a secret that begins to unravel his life. Soon enough, his wife goes missing, more secrets are revealed, and the tension mounts. It's a fun, twisty thriller.

 The series focuses on the 13 murders committed by Peter Sutcliffe in Yorkshire between 1975 and 1980 and blunders, institutional incompetence, and misogyny on the part of local police that allowed Sutcliffe to escape capture for so many years. This is a bleak and tragic, but also compelling, series.

Chris Harris

* **IMDb rating:**  8.4/10
* **Genre** : Crime, Drama, Thriller
* **Starring** : Ashley Walters, Kano, Shane Romulus
* **Created By** : Ronan Bennett
* **TV Rating** : TV-MA
* **Number of Seasons** : 3

 If you prefer your crime stories to be modern, gritty, and at the street level, check out_Top Boy_ .

 The first two series were produced by the BBC and focus on life in an "estate" (aka a housing project) and the tribulations of its residents. The third series was funded by Netflix after the series gained acclaim and international viewership.

 The story of series creator Ronan Bennett seems equally compelling as his creation: He was convicted of involvement in the IRA murder of a police officer in 1975 (his conviction was overturned, and he was released), was later arrested multiple times for involvement with an anarchist organization, and then went on to study at King's College London and later worked for one-time Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
