 Last year, Google made waves by stepping into the world of[ foldable phones](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-foldable-phone-4178374) . Now, rumors are swirling once more about the upcoming Pixel Fold 2\. Here’s what we’ve gathered so far.

##  When Will Google Pixel Fold 2 Be Released? 

 The Pixel Fold 2 (possibly called Pixel 9 Pro Fold) will likely arrive in 2024\. However, this is only Google's second foldable phone, so it's not like we have a lot of history to go off when we guess when the next Pixel Fold will come out.

 The non-foldable Pixel phones have seen an annual refresh, so it makes sense that Google will introduce a new folding Pixel phone every year. We're watching for a mention of it at the[ upcoming Google event](https://www.lifewire.com/google-event-5205756) .

 One piece of news that indicates a 2024 release for the Pixel Fold 2 comes from Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, who says[ screen production started in April](https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767687195090161769) . Young also gives us a glimpse at this phone's screen sizes, which we'll cover below.

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 The Pixel Fold 2 release date will coincide with the[ Pixel 9](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-9-8630767) launch set for August.

##  Google Pixel Fold 2 Price Rumors 

 Google’s latest Pixel Fold came with a hefty price tag, and with hardware improvements expected this year, it's highly unlikely that the cost of the Pixel Fold 2 will decrease. If it remains at a similar price point, anticipate spending $1,799 for this foldable beauty.

## Pre-Order Information 

 Pre-orders for the first Pixel Fold started the day it was announced. If this is repeated this year, you might be able to pre-order the Pixel Fold 2 on May 14\. We'll drop the link here when it's available.

##  Google Pixel Fold 2 Specs and Features 

 Google won't announce this phone for a bit longer. So, while nothing is technically official yet, here's what we know about the Pixel Fold 2 based on assumptions and reliable leakers:

### Bigger Screens 

 One of the major selling points of a foldable phone lies in its dual screens. The[ original Pixel Fold](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-fold-5181117) featured a 5.8-inch exterior/cover screen and a 7.6-inch interior/main screen.

 If Ross Young’s predictions hold, the Pixel Fold 2 will be even more impressive:

* **Cover Screen** : 6.29 inches when the phone is folded
* **Main Screen (Unfolded)** : 8.02-inch tablet-like display

 We've seen conflicting information about the size of these screens. A different source says the cover screen is 6.4 inches and the inner screen measures 7.9 inches. Either way, the displays will likely be bigger this year.

### Bigger Battery 

 Given the larger screens, it’s reasonable to assume that the battery size will also increase.

 While there haven’t been any specific rumors about a battery upgrade for the Pixel Fold 2, consider that the original Pixel Fold boasts a 4,821mAh battery, which already outperforms the batteries in other foldable devices, such as Samsung’s[ Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-z-fold-6-8418354) .

### Google Tensor G4 

 A bigger screen and battery don't always accompany yearly phone upgrades like this one, but a newer, more powerful processor_is_ expected. And that's what we're hearing about the 2024 Pixel Fold.

 The original Fold has the Google Tensor G2 chip, but the Fold 2 is rumored to introduce the Tensor G4 and increase RAM from 12 GB to 16 GB.

 If the Tensor G4 is indeed adopted, it's likely to also be featured in the Pixel 9 later this year. This suggests that the Pixel Fold 2 may not hit the market until the fall.

### Square Camera Bar 

 Another interesting changeup we'll see this year is a new camera layout. Compared to the first Pixel Fold's horizontal camera setup, the next Pixel Fold will have a new, boxy camera bar.[ We first heard about this back in February](https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1760392252751266272) , and now it's confirmed via photos revealed by the National Communications Commission, a Taiwanese regulatory agency.  

![Photos of the Pixel Fold 2](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zNeBoMC-RN8vTsrPwWu1zdc3rcs=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/pixel-9-pro-fold-ca348ad4a08b473bac4eacb8c3c85dd9.png) 

### Smaller Bezels 

 If you've used the Pixel Fold, you know the bezels aren't exactly tiny. And that's really unfortunate for a phone that costs this much. In[ these Pixel Fold 2 renders](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-google-pixel-fold-2-360-degree-video-and-5k-renders-reveal-no-more-horizontal-camera-visor/) , it appears that the bezels may shrink this time around. While this design choice could potentially make the phone slightly more challenging to use, there’s no denying that sleeker bezels lend a more elegant and modern look to the phone.  

### Other Changes 

* According to the source of these renders, the top right of the inner screen houses an under-display camera with a new sensor that isn't included in the current Pixel Fold.
* This Pixel Fold will likely run[ Android 15](https://www.lifewire.com/android-15-7547471) and should get the same seven years of software updates as the Pixel 8.
