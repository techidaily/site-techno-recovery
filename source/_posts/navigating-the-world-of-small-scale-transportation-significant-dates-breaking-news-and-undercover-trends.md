## Navigating the World of Small Scale Transportation: Significant Dates, Breaking News & Undercover Trends
 Micromobility solutions focus on using new technologies beyond the car to encourage people to use mass transit or lighter options to reduce clogged roads and improve commuting and travel in urban areas. Micromobility World kicked off in 2021 and is the first to focus solely on this technology area.[Micromobility Industries](https://micromobility.io/) sponsors the event.

## What Kinds of Topics Are Covered at This Event?

 Disrupting the car is the focus here, so every aspect of the event is about finding alternatives to car ownership and use.

 For 2024, the event was held virtually and featured:

* McKinsey's latest research on minimobility in bicycle cities.
* Micromobility route planning with Pointz, makeea of an app that aims to make biking and scooter riding safe.
* A look at the history of women and scooters by Resilient Accessories, a scooter accessories company.
* The Rider's Choice Awards finale, which recognized companies across 12 categories.

 See the[full schedule](https://lu.ma/hojzc09y) .

 In 2023, Micromobility World highlights, included:

* Kara Swisher's talk about a car-free future.
* Gabe Klein's conversation about the formative role of small electric vehicles in America's EV landscape.
* Roetz Life presentation of its circular e-bike, "designed to ride forever."
* The inaugural Rider's Choice Awards also honored companies in various categories, such as Best Moped Company, Best Board Company, and Best Ride-Hail & Carshare.

 Of course, much goes along with those topics; they don't exist in a vacuum. Anyone interested in sustainability, climate, pollution, economy, and how humans can impact the future by shaping new ideas around urban living should find something of interest here.
