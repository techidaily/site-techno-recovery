## Why Is My TCL Roku TV Not Turning On?

 If your TCL Roku TV doesn’t turn on, your issue could stem from several causes, such as:

* Your remote needs new batteries.
* Your remote lost its connection to your TV.
* Your TV isn’t receiving power.
* The TV has faulty hardware.

 If your Roku TV won’t turn on, but you see a solid or blinking red indicator light, you most likely have a power supply or other hardware issue.

## How Do I Fix My Roku That Won’t Turn On?

 When your Roku TV won't turn on, try these troubleshooting steps, arranged from simplest to more complex, before seeking guidance from your Roku TV manufacturer.  

1. Confirm you’re using the right remote. If you have multiple Roku devices or TVs in your home, make sure you’re using the remote associated with and paired to your TV.
2. Check the connecting cables. First, double-check the power cord fits snugly into your TV and a wall outlet to verify nothing looks amiss with the wires.  
 You might also try plugging the TV into another outlet to see if a dead outlet is the issue.
3. Look for remote interference. Your Roku remote could be experiencing interference with the[infrared (IR) connection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ir-remote-control-5194485) to your TV. Make sure nothing's in the way. You may also have to press the power or home buttons multiple times before the TV responds.  
 Also, be sure to point the remote directly at the TV and that you aren’t too far away.
4. [Reset your Roku remote](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-remote-4176396) . Unplug your TV, remove the remote batteries, and wait 5 seconds before reseating them. Sometimes the act of removing and reinserting the batteries can fix an unresponsive remote. To cover your bases, you could also swap the batteries with a new set.
5. [Try the Roku remote app](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ways-to-use-roku-mobile-app-4176193) . Try powering your TV from the Roku app. Open the app and tap the**Home** button.
6. Use the physical power button on your TV. Take a break from your Roku remote and turn to the power button on your television. On some Roku TV models, this button appears on the bottom or back of the device.
7. Reboot your Roku TV. Unplug your TV to drain the power. Press the power button on your device for as long as the user manual says. Then plug the TV back in and try to turn it on. You could also try the remote sequence to reboot your TV: Press**Home** five times >**Up arrow** \>**Rewind** \>**Fast forward** .  
 Even if you don’t have access to the Roku settings on your TV, unplugging and plugging your device back in functions as a way to reboot your TV. You can also use your remote control to reboot your TV or the pinhole or reset button to factory reset it.
8. [Factory reset your Roku TV](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-4174678) . If power-cycling and resetting the hardware doesn’t seem to make a difference, try a factory reset. Look for a reset button or pinhole on the back of the device and hold it down according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
9. Contact your Roku TV manufacturer for help. If resetting the remote and hardware doesn’t solve your power issue, contact your Roku TV manufacturer. Visit the company’s site or find a contact link from the[Roku support site](https://support.roku.com/article/115006475047) .
