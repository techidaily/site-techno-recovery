##  Hide Photos On Your Timeline and Delete Photo Tags 

 You can hide photos you've been tagged in to prevent people from seeing them on your news feed.

 If you don't want people to easily find photos you've been tagged in, you can untag yourself. Removing tags with your name does not delete those photos but instead removes reference to you from the photo.

 You can find all the photos you've been tagged in by clicking **Activity Log** that appears on your profile page in the lower right of your cover photo. In the left side pane, click **Photo Review** .

1. On the menu bar at the top of Facebook, click the small down arrow on the upper right. Select**Settings & Privacy** .
