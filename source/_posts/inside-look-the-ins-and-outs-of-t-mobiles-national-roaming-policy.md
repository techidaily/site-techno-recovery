## Inside Look: The Ins and Outs of T-Mobile's National Roaming Policy
 T-Mobile provides voice and data services for phones and other mobile devices in the U.S. and elsewhere. The company's Go5G (formerly Magenta) plans offer unlimited talk, text, and data throughout North America, including Mexico and Canada.

 T-Mobile partners with other wireless carriers in areas where T-Mobile does not offer service. When you use your phone in one of those areas,[you are roaming](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-roaming-2377414) . There are no roaming charges for calls or data usage in these areas, but the plan has a roaming limit.

## How Domestic Data Roaming Works

 If you subscribe to the basic T-Mobile plan, you have 50 GB of allotted data, but your roaming limit is 200 MB of domestic data per month. You pay no roaming fees, but when you reach your domestic data roaming limit, access to data while roaming is turned off until you return to an area with T-Mobile coverage or until the beginning of your next billing period.

 T-Mobile sends an alert when you reach 80 percent of your monthly domestic data roaming allotment. You receive another alert when you reach 100 percent. You can also view your usage on the T-Mobile app on your device.

 Wherever you are—roaming or not—you can always connect to data using a Wi-Fi signal.

[T-Mobile offers many plans](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans) . Before you switch from a grandfathered plan, check the details. Previous plans tended to offer more generous (or even un-metered) access than current plans provide.
