## Reset Picture Settings

 To reset the picture, select**Settings** \>**picture icon** \>**Expert Settings** \>**Reset Picture** . Confirm by selecting**Yes** .

![Samsung TV Picture Settings Reset Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ard-GUj2QHqC4Ew7rvlXO6oGKB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-tv-reset-picture-1500-xyz-5b58a02646e0fb0071b58340.jpg)

 This option resets your color, brightness, contrast, and other picture-related settings to the factory defaults. This comes in handy if you've made manual adjustments to the picture but don't like the result and can't get the settings back to where you started. A picture settings reset does not change any other TV settings.

## Reset Sound Settings

 To reset the sound settings, select**Settings** \>**sound icon** \>**Expert Settings** \>**Reset Sound** . Select**Yes** to confirm.

![Samsung TV Smart Sound Settings Reset Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ChDmgfteY0K-7ph4MX_Y1j07has=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-tv-reset-sound-a-1500-xyz-5b58a0d5c9e77c00712f0157.jpg)

 This option resets your sound-related settings such as Balance, Equalizer adjustments, TV installation type (wall/stand), HDMI audio format,[Audio delay](https://www.lifewire.com/audio-video-synchronization-in-home-theater-1846820) , and Auto Volume back to the factory defaults.

 As with picture settings, if you've manually adjusted the sound settings but don't like the result, the Reset Sound option will take you back to the TV's original sound settings. Resetting the sound settings does not change any other TV settings.

## Reset the Smart Hub and Samsung Account Settings

 To reset the Smart Hub settings, go to**Settings** \>**Support** \>**Device Care** \>**Self Diagnosis** \>**Reset Smart Hub** . If you're asked for a PIN, the default value is**0000** .

![Samsung Smart TV Smart Hub Reset Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UcmwI8iAc4ltbJvP-2x8QsUTPc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-tv-reset-smart-hub-a-1500-xyz-5b58a07746e0fb00717c400a.jpg)

 A Smart Hub reset returns those settings to their factory defaults and deletes all information about your Samsung account. After a Smart Hub Reset, you must relink your account to any services and re-establish Smart Hub service agreements.

 Although pre-loaded streaming apps are retained, any apps you've previously added to your My Apps viewing selection must be downloaded and installed again.

## Total Reset

 To perform a total reset, go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Reset** \> enter**0000** \>**Reset** \>**OK** .

 If your TV doesn't have those menus, try one of these paths instead:

* **Settings** \>**Support** \>**Self Diagnosis** \>**Reset**
* **Settings** \>**All Settings** \>**General & Privacy** \>**Reset** .

 The most comprehensive reset option you can do is a total reset of the TV. When initiated, all picture, sound, Smart Hub, and other operational features, such as any broadcast channels saved, are reset to default settings. Network settings are not affected by a total reset.  

 Unplugging the TV from power does not reset it, it just turns it off. If you plug the TV back in it will restart as if you turned it off and on via the remote. A reset is done via the settings.

## Reset Network Connection

 You can reset the network settings on some Samsung TVs via**Settings** \>**All Settings** \>**Connections** \>**Network** \>**Reset Network** . To confirm, press**Reset** .

 If there seems to be[no internet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) on your TV, you can perform a test to identify the issue. Go to Settings > General > Network > Network Status to do that. There's a problem if you see an**X** between the TV and router or between the router and the internet.

 If you can't establish a stable connection using the provided methods, contact your[internet service provider](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) before reaching out to Samsung.

## Reset TV via Remote Management

 In addition to the options you have to reset your TV, you can also have Samsung check your TV and perform all reset functions remotely. In other words, have Samsung take control of your TV.

 This option only works with Samsung Smart TVs connected to the internet.

1. [Contact a Samsung Care Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fremoteservice%2F) and ask about Remote Service (it's free). Make sure you have the model, serial number, and, if possible, the TV software version ready. The agent will also ask you additional questions about the possible problem.
2. Open the**Support** menu on your TV and select**Remote Management** .  
![Samsung Smart TV Remote Management Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/k8fCva6GkD6_DdSYfRy2VI84vYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-support-menu-remote-managment-xyz-5b589f9a46e0fb00719ee55a.jpg)
3. Read the service agreements and enter your**Samsung Account PIN Number** . If you don't have a PIN, enter 0s.

4. Once the Samsung service agent is able to take control of your TV, they will do one or more of the following:  
   * Diagnose the TV.  
   * Adjust the TV's picture, sound, and/or smart hub settings.  
   * Initiate a Factory Reset.  
   * Install any needed software/firmware updates.  
   * Provide any further guidance on whether onsite or carry-in service is required.

## Reset Options for Non-Smart Samsung TVs

 If you have a non-smart TV or an older pre-smart Samsung TV, you can reset the picture and sound settings through a similar on-screen menu as a Smart TV, but there's no Smart Hub or Remote Management option as the TV doesn't have internet capabilities.

 If a total software reset option is provided, the TV will roll back the picture and sound settings, channel menu settings, clock and timer settings, and other settings the user may have changed. Depending on the model year, the on-screen menu layout may vary, so if you're unsure how to access the reset options, consult the user guide for your specific Samsung TV.

## The Bottom Line

 The reset options Samsung provides for its TVs may be necessary to get everything working again. However, before you initiate any reset yourself or take advantage of the Remote Management option, check the following:

* Make sure physical connections are correct and firmly attached.
* If you have a smart TV, check your internet connection.
* [Update the Samsung smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/update-samsung-smart-tv-4172014) if an update is available.
* If your TV isn't responding to your remote, replace the batteries and see if it works again with your TV.
