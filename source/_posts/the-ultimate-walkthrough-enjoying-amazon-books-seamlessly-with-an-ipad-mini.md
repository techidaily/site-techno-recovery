### Method 2: Read Kindle books on iPad Mini with Apple Books App

It's known that Amazon has its own unique eBook format. While iBooks only supports EPUB and PDF formats. Besides, Kindle books are usually protected by their unique Kindle drm scheme. But we can only read Apple DRMed books or free DRM EPUB or PDF eBooks on Apple Books app. So, we can't directly read Kindle books with Apple Books app. For your DRM protected Kindle books, you have to remove Kindle drm first and convert eBook to Apple Books app supported formats. Then transfer Amazon books to iPad Mini for reading.

First, you need to install a professional DRM Removal -- [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) which can not only remove Kindle drm but also can convert eBooks formats.
