## Post-Prime Day Blowout: Snag the New Apple iPad (10Th Gen) for Only $299 - Tech News

If you've been wanting to purchase an iPad, you know how costly these tablets can get. You also know that Apple's products rarely see sales. Following the end of [Amazon's Prime Day sale](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know/), you can still save $50 on the latest base model iPad, the [iPad 10th Gen](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3cb479e3-aa6a-4336-90fc-4bfeee1abf51%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

Following Apple's [Worldwide Developers Conference](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/) in June, the iPad 10th Gen got a [permanent price drop to $349](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-349-ipad-was-sneakily-the-best-announcement-during-apples-let-loose-event/), and right now, you can swipe it up for $299 in the blue, yellow, silver, and pink colors at [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3cb479e3-aa6a-4336-90fc-4bfeee1abf51%7Cdtp&dtb=1) \-- even after Prime Day has come to a close.

This beats the $319 price we saw just a few days ago leading up to Prime Day and prices we saw earlier this month during Fourth of July sales. Remember, Apple products don't frequently see price cuts, and with Prime Day officially over, this iPad deal may be fleeting.

The 10th Gen, released in 2022, is Apple's base-model iPad. It boasts substantial upgrades, like symmetrical bezels, a larger 10.9-inch display, Magic Keyboard Folio support, and the latest software version, iPadOS 16\.

The 10th Gen has thinner bezels surrounding a larger Liquid Retina display in place of the front-facing Touch ID and home button. Apple moved the fingerprint sensor to the outer edge, and dual speakers flank the left and right sides when the tablet is held in landscape orientation. The whole unit weighs approximately one pound.

ZDNET's Kerry Wan went hands-on with the [iPad 10th Gen](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3cb479e3-aa6a-4336-90fc-4bfeee1abf51%7Cdtp&dtb=1) in 2022 and was impressed with Apple's upgrades to its base model. He continued using the tablet well into 2023, [updating his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-10th-gen-2022-review/) in May of that year.

"My 'first impressions' hot take is still ablaze: the iPad beats out the iPad Pro model in two regards. The first is Apple's own accessories. The second area where the regular iPad edges out the Pro is camera placement," Wan wrote in his review.
