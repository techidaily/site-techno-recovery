## How to Set the Timer on Your iPhone Camera

 If you're new to iPhone or never used the timer on the iPhone camera, you might have a bit of trouble finding it. Here's how to find it and how to use it.

1. Open the**Camera** app on your iPhone and choose either the**Photo** or**Portrait** mode.  
 This works whether you're using your front- or rear-facing camera.
2. Tap the up-arrow in the top, center of the screen. Alternatively, you can also swipe up on the**Mode** menu (the horizontal menu directly under the image the camera is displaying) to open**Mode Settings** , as well.  
 On older versions of iOS, the Mode settings may be at the top of the page.

3. Select the**Shutter Timer** icon (it looks a bit like a clock). It may be in different locations on the menu, depending on what Mode you're using and what version of iOS you're running, but the icon will always remain the same.

 The Shutter Timer icon will turn yellow to indicate it is selected.  
 The Shutter Timer will stay selected until you either change it manually or close the camera and then open it back up again.
4. In the menu, tap**3s** or**10s** for 3 or 10 seconds.

5. Then press the shutter button and get into position. The countdown will flash on-screen as it counts down. Once the timer is done, the shutter will fire, taking a series of 10 shots in a short burst.

 If you want your camera to take a burst of 10 shots like it does in Live Mode, then you need to be Live Mode is enabled before you tap the timer. If you haven't enabled Live Mode, the camera will only take one picture, regardless of whether it's on Portrait or Photo Mode.

 Once you capture a picture, open it in the Gallery app to edit it. You can select the Live Mode icon and choose which of the photos you would like to use.

## Does iPhone 11 Have a Camera Timer?

 The iPhone 11 is equipped with a camera timer, even if you have not yet upgraded your device's software. The instructions above should still apply to setting the camera timer, and the timer hold increments (3 or 10 seconds) should remain the same.

 FAQ

* How do I set the camera timer on an iPhone 5?  
 While Apple didn't release this model with a built-in camera timer, iOS 8 upgraded the native camera app with this feature on supported iPhones. If you upgraded your iPhone 5 to at least [iOS 8](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-compatible-ios-8-1999214) , follow the same steps as above.
* How can I set the camera timer on iPhone 4?
