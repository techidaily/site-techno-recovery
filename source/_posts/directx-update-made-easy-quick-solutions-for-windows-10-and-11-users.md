 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**   into the box and click **OK** .

### Method 2: **Meter your Wifi network**

 If you’re using Wifi network, then method 2 will just do the trick. By**metering your Wi-fi network** , Windows will automatically take it that you’re on a limited data plan (even if you aren’t) and stop forcing Windows updates on your computer. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** , type**wifi** and click**Change Wi-Fi settings** .

## **Method 3: Change Group Policy Settings**

 Note that Method 3 works in **Windows Pro** , **Enterprise** , and**Professional** EXCEPT **Windows Home** as it doesn’t have group policy.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key and**   **R**  at the same time, then t ype  **gpedit.msc**  into the box and click  **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b320075a239c.png)

 3) Double-click on **Computer Configuration** \> **Administrative Templates** \>**Windows Components** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b320153b5782.jpg)

 4) Double-click on**Windows Update** \> **Configure Automatic Updates** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b32023756b85.jpg)

 5) Choose**Disabled** , and then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b320453ed059.jpg)

 It’s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.
