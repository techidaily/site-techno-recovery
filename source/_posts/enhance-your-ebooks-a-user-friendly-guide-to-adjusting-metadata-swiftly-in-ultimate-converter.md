\-The tile and the author's name are incomplete or incorrect?

\-couldn't remember it when you found a title among lots of collections?

\-Want to manage these books as the degree of your favorite in order?

\-And more...

If you had the experience one of them above, the tutorial **how to edit ebook metadata** **easily** can be helpful for you. And this is also the reason why I write it for you.

### Why We Should Edit eBook Metadata and Why We Choose the Ultimate Converter

As we known, all the eBooks we purchased from different ebook stores come in all shapes and sizes, and more than often they are with the wrong/misspelled authors name or book title, or even no cover. 

So it's necessary to edit these matadata with a good tool. Here I strongly recommend the[Epubor Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).

You may feel familiar with the name because I have said many times before for its best **DRM Removal + eBook Converter** functions, but now the new release has upgraded and contained the function of editing ebook metadata (things like titles, authors, publishers, covers and more information). What's more, it can not only support DRMed books but also support the DRM free books, including ePub books, PDF books, and Kindle eBooks, etc.

Firstly please download and install the software, and then follow the guide step by step.

You can edit all the useful mata info including the title, author, date, identifiers, language, publishers, the rating star you like and even the introduction of the book.

Then you can transfer these books to your computer or your reader to have a good reading.
