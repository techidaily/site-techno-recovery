Electric leaf blowers have evolved since they first hit the market, and are now just as powerful as their gas counterparts.

Electric leaf blowers use either batteries or extension cords for power, though I recommend battery-powered models since electrical cables are less maneuverable and potentially dangerous in wet weather. Plus, electric leaf blowers don't require engine maintenance, so no need to worry about fuel mix or engine oil -- you'll have more time to actually get work done.

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* 40-minute run-time
* Lightweight design
* Turbo button and cruise control

**Cons** 
* Battery and charger not included

More Details 

**Battery size:** 40V | **Run time:** 40 minutes | **Weight:** 5.5lbs | **Wind speed:** 110mph | **Air volume:** 480cfm | **Charger and battery included:** No 

The Kobalt 40V Max electric leaf blower is the latest version of the model I personally use, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The entire unit is lightweight and easy to use, featuring a variable speed trigger, trigger lock for continuous use, and turbo button for blasting away wet or stubborn debris. I use my leaf blower to clear grass clippings after I mow the lawn, and this leaf blower does an excellent job of handling heavy, wet debris, even without turbo mode.

On a full charge, the Kobalt 40V Max runs for 40 minutes, which is about a month's worth of clearing leaves from your driveway, sidewalk, and patio. Plus, the leaf blower uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt-branded outdoor equipment, so you don't have to buy special batteries. 

The Kobalt 40V Max has a top air speed of 110 miles per hour and can move 480 cubic feet of air per minute (cfm). That means you can clear away everything from wet leaves and fresh grass clippings to fallen acorns and small sticks. The result? Your driveway, sidewalks, and outdoor entertaining areas will look brand new.

## What is the best electric leaf blower?

My pick for the best electric leaf blower is the Kobalt 40V Max cordless model. It's an updated version of the model I personally use for lawn care and yard chores. The ergonomic handle and cruise control switch make continuous use easy and comfortable. And the turbo button gives you extra power for clearing wet and stuck-on debris. It also uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt electric tools, meaning you won't have to worry about maintaining a special battery.

## Which is the right electric leaf blower for you?

When shopping for an electric leaf blower, you want to choose a model that offers a balance of battery life, air speed, and air volume. If you have a larger yard or lots of outdoor entertainment space, you'll want a model with a long run-time, high air volume, and high air speed to handle both dry and wet debris. If you only need to clear your walkways occasionally or have a small yard, a less powerful model will suit your needs.

| **Choose this electric leaf blower** **...** | **If you need…**                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kobalt 40V Max 480cfm                        | A well-rounded electric leaf blower for general yardwork |
| Ego Power+ 765cfm                            | A powerful electric leaf blower with a long run-time     |
| Craftsman 20V Max 200cfm                     | A budget friendly, battery-powered leaf blower           |
| Milwaukee M18 Fuel 450cfm                    | A high-end electric leaf blower                          |
| Ryobi 40V Whisper 730cfm                     | A powerful electric leaf blower for endless leaves       |

## How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?

When analyzing options, I chose battery-powered electric leaf blowers for their power and ease of use. Battery-powered leaf blowers are safer to use than models that require an extension cord, especially if you have a large yard where unwieldy electrical cables could get damaged. I also chose both budget-friendly and high-end models that suit different climates and types of debris.

## Is an electric leaf blower worth it?

They absolutely can be! Not only does an electric leaf blower eliminate harmful exhaust emissions, but it also means you don't have to worry about engine maintenance or mixing oil and fuel. Electric leaf blowers are also comparable to gas models in terms of power, offering you the same capability for clearing debris from your walkways, driveway, and outdoor spaces, without the hassle of a gas engine.

## What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?

Both factors are equally important. Decent wind speed and air volume are both needed to clear debris quickly and efficiently. A leaf blower that offers high air speed but low volume will handle dry leaves and grass clippings well enough, but won't be able to clear wet or stuck-on debris. And a leaf blower that has a high air volume but low speed won't have enough power to clear away anything.

## Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?

Unfortunately, no. But electric leaf blowers have come a long way since they first hit the market, with most brands offering models just as powerful as gas models. 

Also, battery-powered electric leaf blowers have more power than models that require extension cords, since they have brushless motors for efficient power consumption and operation.
