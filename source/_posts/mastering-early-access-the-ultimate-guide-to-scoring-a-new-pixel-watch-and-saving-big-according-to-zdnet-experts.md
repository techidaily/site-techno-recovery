If you're looking for a new smartwatch, the Pixel Watch 3 has more advanced fitness features, such as a readiness score from the previous day's activity and sleep, advanced training metrics thanks to better Fitbit integration, a bigger and brighter display, and additional app integrations like Google Nest and Google TV. 

The Pixel Watch 3 costs $349 for the 41mm version and $399 for the 45mm version. Preorders start today, and the watch will be officially released on Sept. 10\.
