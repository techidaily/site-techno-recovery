##  What is Amazon Prime Day?

 Prime Day is one of the company's biggest sales events of the year. Taking place July 16-17 this year, Prime Day is meant to be like a Black Friday for summertime, and it largely succeeds in doing so.

 While Prime Day historically meant you needed an Amazon Prime account to take advantage of all the best deals, many great sales are not limited to Prime members. That said, some deals are still limited to Prime, and there are a lot of additional Prime benefits to take advantage of, so you may want to consider picking up a subscription.

 Prime Day has thousands of deals available, so it can be hard to sift through the poor discounts and scam sales to find the best. We've done the hard work for youâ€”below are some of the best Amazon Prime Day deals!
