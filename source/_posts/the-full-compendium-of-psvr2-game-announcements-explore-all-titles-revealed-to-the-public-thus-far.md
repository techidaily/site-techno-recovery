##  The Best PlayStation VR 2 Games for Scares 

 Looking for something scary? I recommend these titles to make you feel like you're fighting for your life inside a horror movie.

![Screenshot from Resident Evil: The Village](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V6jQIWVtc6zr6YWGV4yhA1rhuhw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RE_Village_Apr_2021_Screens_05-4177f157cd1d4760bf3ca5e7b5475d66.jpg) 

###  The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR 

_The Dark Pictures_ developer Supermassive Games' original rail shooter,_Until Dawn: Rush of Blood_ , put players onto a terrifying rollercoaster ride full of scares and monsters from that title. The follow-up is the same idea, only it has four episodes to draw from the first "season" of_The Dark Pictures Anthology_ .

**Release Date** : March 2023

### Resident Evil: Village 

 Capcom did PSVR 2 owners a huge service by making the entirety of 2021's_Resident Evil: Village_ playable in virtual reality. This version features manual reloads, the ability to dual-wield weapons, and a new perspective on just how tall internet-favorite vampire Lady Dimitrescu is.

##  The Best PSVR 2 Games for Sports Fans 

 PlayStation VR 2 has a variety of games for people who want a more immersive version of their favorite sports or even a real workout. Here are some of the best.

![Gran Turismo 7](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2IloMRqyYwZJGkYuG2qezVvq02E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gran-turismo-7-psvr2-screenshot-eyetracking-display-en-14feb23-8e143b334e9f46329010b96db4526f72.jpeg)

###  Creed: Rise to Glory – Championship Edition 

 Fans of the_Creed_ movie series will have a blast stepping into the virtual ring._Rise to Glory: Championship Edition_ includes levels and fighters based on all three_Creeds_ , along with the ability to face off against legendary fighters like Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa, and Ivan Drago.

 You have to place your punches, keep your gloves up, and be ready to dodge; you will feel it the next day. This game has closed the rings on my Apple Watch on more than one occasion, and I can confirm that it's a real workout.

###  2MD: VR Football Unleashed All-Star 

 While you don't have to do all the running yourself in this VR football game (that's what analog sticks are for), it will be up to you to block the defenders as you head for the end zone. This title prides itself on its passing physics, which will also exercise your arm.

##  The Best PSVR 2 Games to Relax With 

 Your VR gaming time doesn't have to be non-stop action. Plenty of options are available that will help you unwind at the end of your day.

![Tetris Effect: Connected video game on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Windows PC.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7roJV1mYBrPIndXhqDXNT8DVyhM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tetris-effect-cheats-codes-and-secrets-04-09ea72d3f9a04970859a00d6f72e798f.jpg)

### Puzzling Places 

 If you like jigsaw puzzles,_Puzzling Places_ will do you one better. You'll sit in a virtual space and assemble 3D versions of real places while a beautiful setting and ambient noise surround you. You can start easy with just a few pieces, but you can also go all the way up to 400 if you want an extra challenge.

 I especially love the telekinesis-style grab mechanic: You target a piece, press the Grab button, and it flies into your hand. Whether you're sorting or solving, this feature sets a fun rhythm for moving the pieces around. Best of all, I think this one is fun regardless of the challenge level you've selected

**Release Date** : December 2021

###  Tetris Effect: Connected 

 With this update, the legendary line-clearing game got a complete sensory overhaul, in which every move, flip, drop, and cleared line adds to the soundscape. It's also available "flat," but obviously the fully immersive musical world of_Tetris_ is the better way to play.

 While you are up against some constraints (falling speed, luck, etc.), I still think_Tetris Effect_ is one of the most relaxing PSVR 2 experiences you can have. It's great to just hop into its world for a round or two at the end of the day.

**Release Date** : February 2023

### Kayak VR: Mirage 

_Kayak VR: Mirage_ is a relaxing exploration game that takes you to Antarctica, Norway, and other locations in a tiny, virtual boat. You don't have many goals (although you can do races and speed trials), so you're free to paddle around and say hi to all the penguins.

**Release Date** : February 2023

##  The Best PSVR 2 Action Games 

 PlayStation VR 2 owners who want to push their action skills should check out these games.

![Horizon: Call of the Mountain](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jD6wdUnV4hFDEByl5uWOt1b1YBc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HorizonCalloftheMountain-702c4adc02cf4e5daf6e7de3702753f2.jpeg) 

###  Horizon: Call of the Mountain 

 The_Horizon_ series tasks players with navigating a post-apocalyptic world filled with a bunch of dangerous, animal-themed robots. This VR entry tells a new story with more challenges, and you're still fighting cybernetic dinosaurs with a bow and arrow, so the spirit is still there.

###  The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners (series) 

 Both_The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners_ and its cumbersomely titled follow-up,_The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution,_ drop you into a zombie-filled New Orleans. You'll face various challenges as you try to survive the undead and just bad people as you battle for the soul of the city.

**Release Date** : March 2023

### Resident Evil 4 

 While it's also a horror title in one of the most successful gaming franchises of all time,_Resident Evil 4_ turns up the action with hero Leon S. Kennedy's increased firepower, ability to parry a chainsaw with a knife, and knack for suplexing the undead. The VR edition of this previously flat game brings the battles, scares, and monsters into full 3D.

**Release Date** : TBA

### Moss and Moss: Book II 

 This fantasy series teams you up with Quill, a heroic mouse who goes on adventures. You'll help her solve puzzles and fight monsters along the way, and the whole story is fully narrated. It's whimsical and fun, and the mouse is so brave. I think these are some of the best all-around games for the PSVR 2, and I highly recommend them even if you aren't looking for a

### Humanity 

 You are a heavenly Shiba Inu guiding vast mobs of people to their ascension in this admittedly weird but beautiful game. You'll tell your charges where to turn, where to jump, and which way to go to lead them to each level's exit. It's family-friendly for the cool visuals, forgiving difficulty, and 2D mode. Plus, you're a cool dog.
