## How to Connect Laptop to TV With HDMI Cable

 Connecting your Windows or Mac laptop to your TV via HDMI is fairly straightforward and should hopefully only take a few minutes to complete.

1. Plug one end of the HDMI cable into your laptop’s HDMI port.  
 If your laptop doesn’t have an HDMI port, you will need an HDMI adapter. The exact type will vary depending on your laptop’s model. A docking station or through hub with an HDMI port can also be used.
2. Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to your TV set. Make sure to remember which port you use for your laptop to TV HDMI connection.
3. Using your TV’s remote, change your media source until you get to the HDMI port that you plugged the HDMI cable into.  
 The name of the button will vary by TV model but it’s essentially the same one that you use to switch between regular TV channels, your DVD player, and your video game console if you have one.
4. Your laptop should automatically detect the connection and begin mirroring itself on your TV.

## How to Switch From Mirroring to Extending

 The default setting for a laptop to TV HDMI connection is to have your laptop’s screen mirrored on the television. Whatever you see on your laptop’s screen will be shown on your TV’s screen simultaneously.

 An alternative setting is to have your TV act as a kind of extension or second screen which you can control from your laptop. This option can allow you to open files or apps privately on your laptop and show select media to others on the TV screen.

 To make this change on a Mac, open the Apple menu in the top-left corner and click**System Preferences** or**System Settings** \>**Displays** .

 Depending on your macOS version, the layout may vary, but you'll see the option to select your TV and choose**Extend Display** or**Extended Display** .

 To switch from Mirror to Extend on a Windows laptop, open**Settings** \>**System** \>**Display** \>**Multiple Displays** . On Windows 10 laptops, you can also open the[Action Center](https://www.lifewire.com/the-windows-10-notification-center-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-4150756) and click**Project** to view your TV display options.

 If you're running Windows 11 on your laptop, use the**Windows key+P** keyboard shortcut to bring up display options and switch from mirroring to extend.

 You can change your display preferences as often as you like.

## Do You Need an HDMI Adapter?

 If your laptop doesn’t have an HDMI port, you’ll need to use an HDMI adapter. Your laptop may have come with one when you got it. If not, HDMI adapters are relatively cheap and are very easy to find in both online and traditional electronic stores.

 The following port types can be used to connect a laptop to a TV via HDMI with an appropriate adapter:

* Mini-HDMI
* Micro-HDMI
* [USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490)
* [Thunderbolt](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713)
* DisplayPort
* Mini DisplayPort

 Make sure to check your laptop’s manual or support page to confirm which sort of adapter you need before buying one. A USB-C to HDMI adapter won’t work if you require a Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter (those connectors are different sizes).

## Laptop-to-TV HDMI Troubleshooting

 Having trouble getting the image or sound to play through your TV from your laptop? Here are some quick solutions worth trying.

* **Restart your laptop** : Sometimes[restarting your laptop](https://www.lifewire.com/why-does-restarting-seem-to-fix-most-computer-problems-2624569) with the HDMI cable connected can force its display to switch to the TV screen.
* **Check the HDMI port on your TV** : HDMI ports on TVs can often be very tight; it’s easy to think that the cable has been plugged in when it's barely connected. Firmly and carefully check to make sure that the cable is plugged in as far as it will go.
* **Check the HDMI port on your laptop** : Some laptops, such as some Surface Pro models, have curved edges which can make the HDMI adapters disconnect. Make sure all the edges of the port are sealed and that the cable isn’t being pulled out.
* **Check the HDMI cable for damage** : It’s possible that your HDMI cable may have been damaged while being stored or moved.
* **Install the latest operating system and firmware updates** : Whether you own a Mac or a Windows laptop, downloading the latest[macOS updates](https://www.lifewire.com/update-macos-macbook-pro-4178508) and[Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) can often fix a lot of tech issues.
* **Double-check the HDMI source** : Your TV may be trying to read from the wrong HDMI port. Browse through all of your media sources on your TV with your remote.
* **Switch HDMI ports** : If you think an HDMI port may be damaged, try using a port that’s proven to work such as the one connected to your[Xbox One](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291) or Blu-ray player.
