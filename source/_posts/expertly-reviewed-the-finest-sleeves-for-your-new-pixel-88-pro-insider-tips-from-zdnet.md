You can customize your case with Casetify's designs and your name or monogram. The case comprises 65% recycled plastic, making it a relatively eco-conscious choice.

It has withheld all the drops with no damage to my phone (which is totally multiple times a day). I totally recommend this case!"

This Case-Mate Signature Clear Case is only $45 and offers the highest drop protection on this list. If anything happens to this case and it doesn't live up to its promises, Case-Mate's lifetime warranty can help make amends.

### Burga Tough Case

#### Best Google Pixel 8 case for design

I'll admit, sometimes I prize beauty over functionality. This is a phone you're going to be taking mirror selfies with. Why have an ugly, bland case in all those photos of yours? These Burga Tough cases are by far the cutest in this lineup. One customer said they loved the design, the case feels excellent quality, and it seems to protect their phone well so far. 

Whether you want your Google Pixel decked out in checkers, zebra print, snakeskin, flowers, or doodled hearts, Burga's got you. While not as protective as the other cases on this list, the Burga cases still offer dual-layer protection through a silicone interior, hardshell exterior, and raised bezels for protection where it counts. Cases start at $50.

## Which Google Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro case is right for you?

The proper phone case for you depends on what matters most to you in a case. If you want a versatile phone case that protects your phone upon drops and that you can plug a MagSafe wallet or charger onto, you'd be wise to buy Dbrand's grip case. But if you want a customizable case that matches your style and vibe, a Burga or Casetify case could be the move. Both companies boast cute and unique designs and some drop protection (Case-Mate's case offers 12 feet, Casetify's cases offer 8 feet, while Burga's cases fall short of legit drop protection).

## Factors to consider when choosing a Pixel 8 case:

The cases chosen provide a variety of price points and needs for you to choose from. Ultimately, we weighed the following aspects when curating this list: 

* **Size:** Just because a case is marketed as stylish or protective doesn't mean it'll fit your device. For that reason, you need a case that firmly wraps around your phone, protecting it from drops and bumps while allowing you to use all its physical features.
* **Durability:** You probably wouldn't be checking out this page if you weren't worried about damaging your new Pixel 8\. The best phone cases protect your device from drops, cracked screens, and water damage. You should always look for a case made from high-quality materials such as wood, polycarbonate, or silicone.
* **Style:** We understand if you're only here for the design. Finding the perfect phone case to showcase your unique style is one of the best parts about owning a phone. It's part of who we are, after all. For that reason, we recommend the [Burga Tough Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fburga.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159047%2F1270603%2F15631%3F%26sharedid%3Dzdnet%26partnerpropertyid%3D1980086%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fcollections%252Fgoogle-pixel-8-cases%26subId1%3Dzd-e0cc8ba1d29c4a98a5e22b6373dbcde5-dtp). It does the job regarding day-to-day protection but elevates your phone's uniqueness.
* **Compatibility:** There will always be limitations like any other phone case. Double-check that your other devices are compatible with your new phone case. Unless you plan to replace your phone wallet, pop socket, or ring holder, you might consider getting a universal phone accessory.

## How did we choose these Pixel 8 cases?

We considered several factors while searching for the best Pixel 8 cases. We looked at top brands and customer reviews (good and bad) when considering these Pixel 8 cases to select our top picks. When we go hands-on with a phone case, we consider ease of setup, performance quality, functionality, and value for the price.

## Do Google Pixel phones need a case?

Even if you have gone without a screen protector or phone case on your past phones, you can't count on good luck and gracefulness forever. The laws of gravity come for us all. Eventually, you're going to drop your phone. When that happens, and if your phone breaks, screen repairs, and damage could cost you hundreds of dollars -- far more than a screen protector and phone case will. 

## What cases work for Google Pixel 8?

Case brands like Casetify, Dbrand, Spigen, Case-Mate, and Burga all offer compatible cases for the Google Pixel 8 series.

## How much does the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro cost?

The Pixel 8 starts at $699 and the Pixel 8 Pro starts at $999.
