College is often hectic, and trying to score an impressive tech internship can feel overwhelming. If you're interested in the tech industry, an internship allows you to apply your newfound skills — and perhaps line up a post-graduation job. In other words, it's an important step in your career.

Whether finance, software, or engineering interests you, tech internships are available to you. Companies of all types hire hundreds of interns every season. 

Read on for practical advice on deciding what kind of internship you want and tailoring your resume for tech internships to prepare you for recruitment. 

## What is a tech internship?

Tech internships are an opportunity to earn college credits, test-drive a job, and apply practical knowledge to real-life situations. Completing an internship is a good first step toward your career. Some internships end in a part-time or full-time job offer. 

Tech companies hire for internships year-round. Companies like Google, Meta, Airbnb, and Uber hire hundreds of interns each session. Most internships start in September, January, and June and last two to three months to align with school semesters. 

How much internships pay depends on the company. Some companies pay hourly or a set amount for the entire term. Unpaid internships are less common now but still exist. Review intern pay policies before applying at companies that interest you.

### Tech internship benefits

* Practical experience to add to your resume
* Networking opportunities for future career opportunities
* School credits
* Possible compensation
* Possible higher earning potential due to experience
* Potential job offer after internship completion

## How to land a tech internship

Landing a tech internship relies on proper prep work. Pick the right internship, learn how to network, and prepare for interviews to set yourself apart from other applicants. 

### 1\. Start preparing early

Start looking no later than the season before the internship starts. 

If you're looking for a role during the school year, you should apply three to six months before the internship starts. You'll have time to plan your course load or determine any additional [scholarship needs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer-science-scholarship/). 

Courses like [basic programming](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/easiest-programming-languages-to-learn/) will prepare you for internship applications before recruitment starts. Other students will likely take the same courses, so [set yourself apart](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ways-to-advance-your-technology-career/) with side projects and extracurriculars. 

Networking is an easy way to get a referral, so try to start networking as early as possible. 

Alumni from your school who work at your desired company are a good place to start — you already have something in common. 

### 2\. Decide what kind of internship you want

Tech is an enormous field with hundreds of potential job titles. Start paying attention to the industry. Follow tech news sources — such as this very website — to learn more about it.
