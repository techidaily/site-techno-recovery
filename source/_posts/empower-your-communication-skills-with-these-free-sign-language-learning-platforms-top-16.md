## Empower Your Communication Skills with These Free Sign Language Learning Platforms (Top 16)
 These free sign language classes use a variety of techniques to teach you sign language so you can communicate with a loved one or simply have fun learning to sign.

 Included in these free sign language resources are videos, quizzes, puzzles, games, diagrams, and printables that will really help you learn how to sign or how to build on the sign language that you already know.

_If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation._

## Free Online Sign Language Classes

 Some of these are huge courses with many units to teach you the complete sign language, and others are smaller that will just teach you the basics. Whatever class you choose, you'll have a great time building up your skills.

### American Sign Language University's Free Sign Language Classes

 There are plenty of great resources available from American Sign Language University (ASLU). On top of the 60 lessons, dictionary search, and numbers guide, you can find a fingerspelling practice tool, quizzes, and several word search puzzles, among other things.

 You'll find many videos on sign language here, and the lessons are in order of difficulty, so you can progressively learn to sign like you would with any other language.

 Be sure to check out the[First 100 Signs](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/concepts.htm) videos for a great introduction to common signs used between parents and younger children. There are also some sentences you can practice using the signs you learned from the videos.

 There are 12 free sign language units, and several additional free videos, available from Dr. Byron W Bridges. Youâ€™ll start off learning basic vocabulary, like greetings, food, and school-related signs. The final lessons teach you emotions and full conversations.

 There are quizzes throughout the lessons, and be sure to take them seriously, because you only get five attempts for each quiz. The free lessons donâ€™t include completion certificates, support, or midterms or final exams.

 After completing these videos, you should have a better grasp on the basics of sign language.

 You can also watch these sign language videos and others[on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs79SiE-PD3AUy2clzrSlog/videos) .

 Printable sign language charts are good for instant reference. Put a few in your pocket, place them around the house, or spend some time memorizing them to learn offline.

* [Start ASL's free sign language chart](https://www.startasl.com/free-sign-language-chart/) : This resource provides images of comon words like "what," "how," "hungry," "bathroom," "woman," and "food" being signed. Instructions for how to sign are below most of them.
* [Lifeprint's alphabet fingerspelling](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/wallpaper1.htm) : Print these two sets of pictures to learn the alphabet. Both sets have the letters on the hands, but they also have a version without the letters for practice.
* [These numbers/common words/letters](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/learning-languages/american-sign-language/signing-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-208315/) : This cheatsheet is similar to the other printables here with four images you can print for keywords, such as "how," "which," "where," "yes," "please," "thanks," "goodbye," etc. There are also printables for the alphabet and numbers one through 10.
* [Print individual letters in sign language](https://www.teachersprintables.net/category/sign%5Flanguage) : These printables includes large letters of the alphabet represented in sign language. One way to use these is to print them off and place them next to objects that start with that letter for passive learning.

## Online Sign Language Games

![Deafsign sign language game](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IQalTEok0f9rsq2T7BbkUjCQIPE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/deafsign-game-aa058ef7a9864e928cc4f1e12053e33a.png)

 Online games can make learning sign language fun. If you've completed a few courses or spent some time with a sign language app or worksheet, play a game to test what you've learned.

* [Sporcle's Sign Language Live: Colors](https://www.sporcle.com/games/THEJMAN/asl-colors) : This game tests whether you can name all 18 colors before the 15-minute timer is up.
* [Choose the Sign](https://www.deafsign.com/ds/index.cfm?scn=games) : These puzzles give you random signs, and you must select the right answer from the ones given. There are also four tests with similar questions available through that link.
* [What's the Number?](http://asl.bz/) : This game signs a number to you and you must provide the correct answer. You can adjust the amount of time the sign remains on the screen, and you can play with numbers from zero through nearly a billion!
