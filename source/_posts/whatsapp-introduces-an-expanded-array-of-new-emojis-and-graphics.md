## WhatsApp Introduces an Expanded Array of New Emojis and Graphics

Compared to its competitors like Telegram, WhatsApp’s sticker support has been pretty limited, especially on Android. Meta just expanded that support with a new GIPHY integration, AI-generated stickers, and a custom sticker maker for Android devices.

 WhatsApp announced four new features to improve your experience with stickers across the app. [GIPHY](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/mastering-sound-and-filter-integration-in-windows-10-photos-app-for-2024/) has an extensive sticker library that powers the sticker features in popular apps like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and others. Meta has now added that library to WhatsApp. You can use its stickers by searching in the sticker tray, either with text or emojis.

 WhatsApp users on iOS can quickly create stickers using the built-in [custom sticker](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-zte-blade-a73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) maker app. It lets them turn photos into stickers (after removing their background and cropping them), add text, or doodle over them. They can share and save these stickers within the sticker tray. Meta has now brought this custom sticker maker feature to the Android app too. “iOS users have been loving this feature and we’re excited to expand it to everyone,” the official announcement reads.

 If you can’t find a relevant sticker in the GIPHY library, you can quickly generate custom stickers using [Meta AI](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-getting-the-most-out-of-live-sports-on-youtube-tv/). It works with basic text prompts on both Android and iOS devices, but it’s currently only available to users in the U.S. For iOS users, the language options are limited to English. The Android app can generate AI stickers in Spanish and Bahasa Indonesia too.

 Along with all these new features, Meta is also trying to tidy up the interface to make it easier to find new relevant stickers. WhatsApp will automatically show sticker recommendations below the downloaded sticker packs, and allow you to quickly add them to your favorites. You can also hold and drag stickers around to quickly find them later. Moving a sticker on top of another will replace it.
