### What to Know

* To disable autoplay in Apple Music on iPhone, open the current song and tap the**Autoplay** icon until it’s deselected.
* Repeat these steps and highlight the**Autoplay** icon to enable or turn on continuous play in Apple Music.

## How to Stop Apple Music From Automatically Playing on iPhone

 By default, the[iOS Music app](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-music-on-ios-4684678) will continuously play songs from the Apple Music library until told otherwise. It can be frustrating when you want to listen to a single tune or album and then go about your day.

 Here’s how to stop Apple Music from playing tracks automatically.

1. Open the Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.  
 The iOS Music app is a completely separate app from the iTunes Store app.
2. Tap the mini-player along the bottom of the screen that shows the current song that's playing. If nothing is playing, begin playing one.  
 It doesn’t matter which song you play as this change we’re about to make to Apple Music’s Autoplay settings will apply across the app for all tracks.
3. Tap the**Up Next** icon in the lower-right corner of the screen.  
 It’s the one that looks like three dots and lines stacked on top of each other.
4. If Autoplay is activated, you should see an Autoplay playlist in the lower half of the screen and a highlighted Autoplay icon to the right of the song playing. Tap the**Autoplay** icon to disable it.  
![Turning off Autoplay settings in Apple Music app on iPhone.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5RZwYhTcpXjS0K1VBHG9SGvcj9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NEW10-d805952bf4c34b1bbaef6067467b8299.jpg)  
 The**Autoplay** icon is the one that looks like an infinity symbol.
5. If done correctly, the Autoplay playlist should immediately disappear, and Apple Music will now stop automatically playing.
6. You can now return to the app's front screen by tapping the**Up Next** icon once again and then swiping down to minimize the player.

 To enable Autoplay in Apple Music, repeat these steps and make sure that the icon is highlighted and the Autoplay playlist is visible.

## Tips to Stop Apple Music From Playing Automatically  

 Sometimes Apple Music can seem to start up automatically when connecting to a car system, a speaker, or a pair of headphones or earphones. While it’s unlikely that the cause is an official iPhone or Apple Music feature, there are still several things you may want to try to prevent this from happening.  

* **Put your AirPods in their case** .[Apple AirPods](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-airpods-4766801) can detect when you're wearing them, but gripping them in your hand or even having them in a dark pocket can trick them. Keeping them in the case will ensure they don’t turn on by themselves and automatically trigger music playback.  
* **Watch your earphones** . Similar to Apple’s AirPods, many earphones allow you to[control music on an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/use-remote-button-on-your-iphone-headphones-to-control-music-2438265) and make it appear as if apps are automatically playing by themselves.  
* **Disable Bluetooth on your iPhone** . If Apple Music keeps playing automatically every time you get into your car, the easiest way to stop it is to[turn off your iPhone or iPad’s Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-off-bluetooth-on-phones-4171879) to prevent a connection from being made. You may also want to turn off your[car's Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-car-stereo-basics-534558) if you don't use it for anything else.  
* **Is it Apple Music or Spotify?** Many smart cars and speakers have built-in[Spotify](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829) functionality. Spotify could be acting up instead of Apple Music. If your device has a display, check to see which app is playing.  
* **Disable Handoff** . The[iPhone’s Handoff feature](https://www.lifewire.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handoff-4079966) continues media playback on devices once they’re detected automatically. You can customize and even disable Handoff by opening**Settings** and going to**General** \>**AirPlay & Handoff** .
