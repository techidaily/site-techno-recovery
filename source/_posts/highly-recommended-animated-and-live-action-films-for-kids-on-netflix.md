**Runtime** : 1 hour, 32 minutes

 Eleven-year-old Orion has a great imagination—and a lot of fears. He spends much of his time sketching out those fears in order to overcome them, but the worst imaginable scenario ensues: His drawings and fears literally come to life from the page. Orion then meets the friendly Dark who takes him on an unforgettable adventure around the world—and helps him accept his insecurities.

 Some of the imagery in this Charlie Kaufman-directed animated film is quite vivid, which makes this movie best suited for older children. But it could be a helpful entry point for discussing anxiety and finding tools to manage fears of the unknown.
