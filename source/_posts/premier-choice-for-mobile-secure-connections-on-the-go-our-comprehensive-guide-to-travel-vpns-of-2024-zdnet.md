## Premier Choice for Mobile Secure Connections on the Go: Our Comprehensive Guide to Travel VPNs of 2024 | ZDNET

When you travel for work or for fun, you don't want to leave security and privacy at home. A [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) can keep your data safe and mask your online activities, enhancing your privacy no matter where you are in the world. 

Connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot in an airport, hotel, or coffee shop may be convenient, but it definitely isn't secure. That's where a VPN comes in. The best VPNs create secure, encrypted tunnels that protect your internet traffic, providing an extra layer of protection. That means your financial information or login credentials are at lower risk of exposure or theft. 

You should always use a VPN to protect your privacy, especially when away from home. These services may also help you access streaming services typically available in your home region.

### NordVPN

#### Best travel VPN overall

In our testing of NordVPN, we found it had a fast and reliable connection and was generally consistent across a wide range of situations. If you're traveling, you can likely depend on NordVPN no matter where you're connecting from.

[NordVPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-does-nordvpn-work-plus-how-to-set-it-up-and-use-it-tutorial/) also supports (peer-to-peer) P2P sharing and is one of our favorite VPNs for streaming. It offers a second layer of encryption through its Double VPN feature and a dedicated IP bolt-on service. 

**Review:** [**NordVPN offers consistent speed and performance**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-review/)

Regarding compatibility, NordVPN supports all major platforms and has additional browser plugins for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Furthermore, the company provides 10 simultaneous device connections under one account and a server network thta includes 111 countries.

Overall, NordVPN is one of the best VPNs, especially for travel. It has a 30-day money-back guarantee, which should give you enough time to test the product and see if it's the right fit for you. 

After years of use, I've found it to be user-friendly and quick to connect. I prefer this VPN as my travel option, as I can leave it running without any noticeable speed loss. It can also access Netflix, most of the time, without a problem. Customers also like how easy the VPN app is to use and the fact that it offers good speeds, although some have flagged inconsistent pricing. 

Prices start at $3.09 per month on a Standard two-year plan, including three months of free access. One-year plans start at $4.99\. If you also want cybersecurity protections and coverage for identity theft, consider the Ultimate subscription, which begins at $5.99/month. Alternatively, you can choose one month of service for $12.99.

**NordVPN features:** **Servers:** 6,200+, 111 countries | **Simultaneous connections:** 10 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge | **Logging:** No activity logs | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Supports multiple devices and operating systems
* Expansive server network
* Simple user interface
* Strong privacy audits

Cons 
* Expensive
* Connections are not unlimited
* Can be difficult to cancel subscriptions

### ExpressVPN

#### Best travel VPN for mobile

ExpressVPN has a sizable server network in 105 countries, so no matter where you travel, you'll likely be able to connect to a local server.

ExpressVPN is a widely used VPN provider that supports many platforms and devices. It's also one of the [best VPNs for iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/) and a top VPN for Android, making it useful for traveling, especially when using multiple devices on different operating systems.

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN review: A fine VPN service, but is it worth the price?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

ExpressVPN's [privacy policy](https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-vpn/policy-towards-logs) clearly outlines what information it collects. It doesn't log data that could be used to identify you, such as your IP address, browsing history, or DNS queries, and an [independent privacy audit](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/kpmg-privacy-policy-audit/) in December 2023 revealed no logging or data collection issues. The company also provides an ad blocker and the option to block explicit content.

One downside, however, is that the number of simultaneous devices you're permitted depends on your plan, with a maximum of eight.

During long-term usage, I have found that ExpressVPN offers some of the best overall speeds and stable connectivity, although, on rare occasions, I need to switch servers as speeds suddenly drop, or I come across a website that is blocking my new IP. Customers say that while expensive, this VPN provides bang for your buck, bolstered by solid customer support.

Subscriptions begin at $6.67 per month with a 12-month plan (the "deal" has been in place for years, so consider this the standard price). This includes three months of free access and Backblaze cloud backup. You can also opt to pay $9.99/month for six months or $12.95 for one month of access. 

**ExpressVPN features: Servers:** 105 countries | **Simultaneous connections:** 8 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and more | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* 100 countries
* No logs
* Free months on offer

Cons 
* Expensive monthly plans
* Initial connections can be slow

### Surfshark VPN

#### Best budget-friendly travel VPN

Surfshark offers reliable and fast connections at average speeds. It is also a secure option, as our recent tests found no DNS leaks.

The company doesn't log your activity while you use the service and offers private DNS capabilities, which Surfshark calls [NoBorders](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.surfshark.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360010423359-What-is-NoBorders-and-how-to-use-it-) mode. This feature enables you to access sites regardless of restrictive border connections. Be careful, though. Countries restricting access tend to frown on bypassing those restrictions.

**Review:** [**Surfshark VPN: Unlimited connections make it a solid value pick**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

Surfshark VPN has many features, including split tunneling, a kill switch to keep your connection secure if it drops, MultiHop (a double VPN), static and rotating IP addresses, and an ad blocker. There are also inexpensive add-on tools, including a tracker-free search engine, data breach scanner, and antivirus software.

Speeds are reasonable, especially when you consider the price point. It can be slower than competitors, but not to a drastic degree. One downside is that initial connections to servers can be slow. 

Additionally, Surfshark operates a live [warrant canary](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fwarrant-canary) and is independently audited.

A feature I particularly like is the option to either disconnect entirely or pause your VPN tunnel for five minutes, 30 minutes, or two hours. Customers applaud Surfshark's customer service, but some have noted billing issues.

Surfshark subscriptions start at $2.19 per month for a two-year plan (three months free) and $2.79 per month for a one-year subscription. Alternatively, you can sign up for one month for $15.45\. You are billed for the complete package at the time of sign-up.

**Surfshark VPN features:** **Servers:** 3,200+, 100 countries | **Simultaneous connections:** Unlimited | **Kill switch**: Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Firefox, Chrome | **Logging:** No activity logs | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Extremely easy to use
* Expansive server network
* Ad-blocking
* Malware-blocking
* Independent privacy audit

Cons 
* Located in the US
* Mid-range speeds

### Private Internet Access

#### Best travel VPN for ease of use

Private Internet Access is an excellent choice if you want a set-and-forget VPN while you're on the road. This VPN has a broad server network, but its main strengths are its simplicity and ease of use. Download, click the connection button, and the VPN will do the rest. 

We also like how the open-source, Wireguard-based VPN is laid out. Location options and customizable settings are easy to reach without technical jargon to confuse new VPN users, and everything is packaged in a stylish user interface. You can also take advantage of features including split tunneling, a kill switch, and ad blocking.

During testing, PIA often performed well in speed, connection stability, and access to streaming services. Customers find the service is reliable, and it appears to work well in many locations worldwide.

If you opt for a two-year plan at $2.19 per month, you will receive two months of free access. If you want to try it out, you can buy a month's worth of access for $11.99 or opt for a six-month contract at $7.50/month.

**Private Internet Access features: Servers**: 91 countries | **Simultaneous connections**: Unlimited | **Kill switch**: Yes | **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS, routers, NAS | **Logging**: No activity logs | **Money-back guarantee**: 30 days

Pros 
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* Highly configurable app
* Fast connection times

Cons 
* Bland user interface
* Speeds can lag

### IPVanish VPN

#### Best travel VPN for unlimited connections

[IPVanish](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review/) is a highly customizable VPN with a user-friendly interface and app configuration options. The app gives you many server selection options and shows each location's ping speed and server load.

These features can be valuable when you're on the road because they allow you to choose the optimal server based on your current location, which can vary depending on your location. IPVanish is also a good option for [streaming](https://www.ipvanish.com/vpn-for-streaming/) services.

**Review:** [**IPVanish: A VPN with a wealth of options**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review-a-rich-wealth-of-options-and-surfing-controls/)

If you prioritize the freedom to configure your VPN to your liking while still having the ability to choose from an extensive list of countries and servers, this is the VPN for you. The user interface is basic and unattractive, but it's easy to use and lays out speed statistics, country options, and more in a simple format. Customers say this VPN is easy to use on all platforms.

IPVanish offers a discounted plan for $2.19 per month if you commit to two years. This increases to $2.79/month for an annual plan and $12.99 for one month. Three months of free access are added to one- and two-year plans.

**IPVanish VPN features:** **Servers**: 2,000+, 75+ locations | **Simultaneous connections**: Unlimited | **Kill switch**: Yes | **Platforms**: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, Chrome, Apple TV | **Logging**: No activity logs | **Money-back guarantee**: 30 days

## Factors to consider when choosing a travel VPN

When you are deciding on the most suitable travel VPN for you, you should consider the following factors:

* **Price**: VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars. That said, you may be interested in paying top rates if you want additional features, such as password managers or reliable connections in countries such as China.
* **Trial length**: You need to consider your preferred price point regarding how long you think you will need a VPN. If you're in it for the long haul, consider a two-year subscription -- as you also tend to earn the best prices with the longest terms. Some VPNs will offer more extended options, but if you're only traveling for a month, you might be willing to pay a little extra so that you are not tied to a yearly contract or more.
* **Server countries**: If you're going to another country, be sure to check that your VPN works there. Most VPNs work in many countries without a problem, but some areas -- such as China or Russia -- may require specific VPNs, and they typically cost more.
* **Security**: Consider the VPN provider's security track record. Preferably, the VPN will be open to external audits, and the company hasn't suffered any significant recent data breaches. You will also want a VPN provider that constantly improves its security posture.
* **Streaming**: If you plan to use your VPN to access your streaming service home library, check to make sure your VPN can access your favorite platform. (If you're experiencing issues abroad, switching servers often resolves the problem.)
* **Legality**: Some countries frown upon the use of VPNs, whereas others ban them entirely. If you're going to a new country known for censorship, check the local laws first.

## How we test VPNs

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by ZDNET's team. We've been talking about other VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

Therefore, our team tested and analyzed the best VPNs for travel in 2024 using the following criteria that is most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance, especially while you're in different countries. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Testing:** ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. After all, every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured that the development team behind each recommended VPN cares about improving security over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: VPNs can be vital to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations perform well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you stream.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee.

## What is a VPN?

A VPN is a [virtual private network](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-does-it-work/) that allows you to browse the internet privately and securely, including connecting to public Wi-Fi networks with a layer of protection that masks data. VPNs allow you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through worldwide servers. A VPN can also encrypt your traffic, keeping your online activities hidden from prying eyes.

If, however, your online activities are monitored at the ISP level -- say, by a government -- they may recognize a VPN's "signature." While they can't see the details of what you're doing, they will know that a VPN is in use.

VPNs are useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be a vital tool for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are essential services for anyone who wants to maintain their security and privacy online. 

## What is a travel VPN, and why do I need it?

A travel VPN is a virtual private network that provides a secure internet connection while you travel. It encrypts your online traffic and hides your IP address, protecting sensitive data from cybercriminals and government surveillance. It also allows you to bypass internet censorship and geo-restrictions.

A VPN is useful when relying on public internet hotspots, such as those available at hotels. While you should avoid using public internet hotspots as much as possible for security reasons, a VPN will help protect your privacy if you have no other option.

You may also want a travel-suitable VPN for accessing content geo-linked to your home rather than your new location.

## What should I do if I experience traffic slowdowns with a VPN?

If you experience traffic slowdowns, check the VPN and Wi-Fi connection between your device, router, or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops.

Keep in mind that if you are on the road, and you are relying on a free hotspot or hotel connection, your base speed may be lower and might not meet the standards of your home connection.

## Will a travel VPN slow down my internet speed?

A VPN might slow your internet speed if the data is encrypted and decrypted before transmission. A good travel VPN should have a minimal impact on your speed, and the added security is worth the slight loss in speed.

If you use a public hotspot or hotel connection while you're away, your speed will likely be low at the source and not as fast as you are used to at home.

## Are travel VPNs legal?

Using a VPN is legal in most countries, but some exceptions exist. Some countries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, restrict VPN usage or have banned the use of VPNs entirely. Other countries have some restrictions on VPN usage. It's essential to research the local laws of the country you're traveling to before using a VPN.

## How can I find out what the VPN rules are for the countries I'm visiting?

There are several sources. Reaching out to your VPN vendor is always a good idea. They often have a good feel for the countries in which their services operate and will frequently post guidance on their websites.

If you're a US citizen, consider using US State Department resources. The department lists travel advisories for US citizens, and has foreign service officials who can provide general guidance. Check the [travel advisories webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/). Your nation's foreign ministry may have a similar service if you're outside the US.

To understand which countries ban or discourage VPN usage, NordVPN has a [legal guide](https://nordvpn.com/blog/are-vpns-legal/) that lists countries with severe restrictions, bans, and possible penalties for breaking VPN laws. 

## Is a VPN all I need to be protected while traveling?

No. VPNs can generally protect your data while it's in motion. If your computer or phone is seized, however, it's possible law enforcement can access your data, even if it's encrypted. Some governments might hold your devices without giving you a reason.

Online services you access in another country might have less protection than those in your host country. Of course, normal travel security issues, like being careful what you spend, how you handle cash, who you trust, and so on, also carry risks during travel.

## What is a DNS leak and why does it matter?

A DNS leak is the exposure of your information -- such as DNS queries -- outside of secure, encrypted tunnels when you are using a VPN. If your activity is exposed, this compromises the whole point of using a virtual private network in the first place. 

The majority of reputable VPNs will ensure that DNS leaks don't happen, but if you can, use an online service like [DNS leak test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to check your connection.

## If my hotel has a wired connection, do I still need to use a VPN?

Yes. Don't assume any network endpoint is safe when traveling. Always make sure your connections are encrypted when communicating from any network connection.

## Can a VPN help me save on airfare?

Many VPN services claim you can save hundreds of dollars on flights by changing your location. Plenty of blog posts with anecdotal evidence support the theory that a VPN can help cut the price of your plane ticket. The reality is less clear, and the most likely scenario is that no one knows how much (if at all) a VPN can help you score cheap flights. 

Airfare prices are set by algorithms based on complicated factors, such as changing demand. You could notice a price difference using a VPN to spoof your location, but the change in cost may or may not be related to your location. Practically, it isn't easy to account for every possible variable. Also, given the amount of data available to consumers, the real advantage of using a VPN may be that it remains anonymous.

Another way to look at it is if a VPN reduces the cost of airfare, it's most likely not going to have as big of an impact as other factors. There are different tactics for booking cheap flights that should be higher on your priority list. Booking early, keeping an eye out for price drops (check if there are change fees before booking), or traveling during days or times of day when there is less demand are great ways to secure the best possible flight prices.

## How do I set up a travel VPN?

To set up a travel VPN, subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software for your device. Then, open the software and sign in using your credentials. Choose a server location and connect to the VPN. Once connected, your internet traffic should be encrypted, and your IP address should be hidden.

Remember, you can use a VPN on different devices, including your laptop and smartphone.

## Can a VPN make it look like I am in another country?

Yes. You can choose your home country as a default location, but if you would prefer to have an IP assigned from a different country -- the US rather than the UK, for example -- you should be able to do so. The available locations vary depending on the VPN you are using.

## Can I access my streaming service abroad?

If you're a paid subscriber to a streaming service, such as Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video, you can often access your streaming service while you're away from home. You can use a VPN to change your IP address to another point of origin -- and if this is set to your home location, you should have access to your library.

Using a VPN to access other libraries may go against your terms of service and the streaming platform's licensing agreements, so keep this in mind.
