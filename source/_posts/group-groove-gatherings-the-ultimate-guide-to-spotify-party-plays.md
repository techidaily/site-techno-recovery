Close 

###  What to Know

* Open the**Spotify app** on your phone or tablet and select a song or podcast episode.
* Tap**Connect** \>**Start a Jam** \>**Invite Friends** and select a sharing method.

 This article includes instructions for how to use Spotify Jam (formerly Group Session) in the mobile app so you can start a music listening party with your friends.

##  How to Make a Listening Party on Spotify 

 To start a listening party with your friends, select a track or playlist and start a Jam to access a sharing link. Here's how to do that.

 Once a Group Session is live, [ everyone will have the same playback controls](https://www.lifewire.com/have-two-people-listen-to-spotify-at-same-time-5205195) . Anyone can play, pause, skip or add tracks in the queue at any time. To limit participants to adding tracks only, select the**gear** icon and deselect**Let others change what's playing** .

1. Open the**Spotify app** on your phone or tablet.
2. Select a song or podcast episode.  
 Pick a song that’s part of a playlist so that you have many options to choose from off the bat. Otherwise, you can use the**Add songs** button for suggestions or rely on Jam participants to add to the queue.
3. Tap the**Connect** icon on the**Now Playing** bar.
4. Select**Start a Jam** .

5. Click**Invite Friends** .  
 If a friend's nearby, select**Scan QR code** to display a QR code they can scan to instantly join your Jam. You can also tap your phones together to allow your friend to join; this feature works if you're both logged in to Spotify and connected to Bluetooth.
6. Select**Share link** to share a link with friends in messaging apps like Messages,[ WhatsApp](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-whatsapp-all-about-4781062) , or[ Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) .  
 Spotify lacks built-in chat functionality, so you’ll need to use a third-party app if you want to chat with friends during a Jam.
7. To end the Jam, tap**End** .  
![Options to share a Spotify Jam link and end the session in the Spotify mobile app for iOS.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qQBAU4mHPZC89EWOAt4-QjsDs0k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_listen-to-spotify-with-friends-5120356-169432ba821842c4bd6d694dd0cac138.jpg)  
 Anyone can exit a Jam by selecting**Leave** . If the host leaves the Jam, this action automatically ends the listening session for everyone.

##  What Is Spotify Jam (formerly Group Session)? 

 If you’re not in the mood for watching a video streaming service virtually with friends, Spotify has you covered.

 The popular music streaming platform has a feature called Jam (formerly Group Session) that lets up to 32[ Spotify Premium users](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-spotify-premium-4580347) , as well as free users, attend a virtual listening party. Once connected, you and your friends can listen to any song or podcast on Spotify simultaneously. 

 Spotify introduced the Group Session feature in May 2020 and Spotify Jam in 2023\. Only Premium users in the same location could listen together at the launch of Group Session, but Spotify later expanded it to allow worldwide connections.

 Jam hosting is only available to Spotify Premium users, but free users can join listening sessions. The Jam feature is also available on Spotify’s desktop app by right-clicking a song or playlist.
