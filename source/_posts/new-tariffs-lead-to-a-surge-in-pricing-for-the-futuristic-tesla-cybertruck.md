## New Tariffs Lead to a Surge in Pricing for the Futuristic Tesla Cybertruck

The Cybertruck already costs more than Tesla's initial promised price point, and early models are having many hardware and software problems. Tesla is now pushing prospective customers toward pricier models, by removing the entry-level Rear-Wheel Drive and jacking up prices of other models.

 The All-Wheel Drive model can now be yours in exchange for $79,990, while the flagship Cyberbeast model is ten bucks short of $100,000 at $99,990\. Meanwhile, the $60,990 Rear-Wheel Drive is no more.

* **Rear-Wheel Drive** was $60,990 but is no longer offered
* **All-Wheel Drive** was $79,990 but is now $99,990
* **Cyberbeast** was $99,990 but is now $119,990

 Tesla changed the pricing of its Cybertruck models on August 6, according to cached pages. Buying an entry-level Cybertruck now means paying an extra $39,000 as the All-Wheel Drive is now a new base model and costs more than before. The difference between Cyberbeast's new price and the removed Rear-Wheel Drive model is a whopping $39,000\. You could almost buy a new Tesla Model 3 for the same money, or one of several competing electric cars, like the [Kia Niro EV](https://www.kia.com/us/en/niro-ev) (which starts at $39,600) or the [Nissan Leaf](https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/electric-cars/leaf.html) (which starts at $28,140).

 When Tesla first revealed the Cybertruck in 2019, the company said it would start at $39,990\. Tesla is notorious for constantly changing the prices of its electric vehicles, with little regard to customers who see the resale value of their prized investment swing wildly as a result. It's not surprising that the Cybertruck is getting the same treatment, but it's certainly a bold move to raise the price shortly after its fourth recall.

 Tesla has updated shipping estimates from the previous 2025 deliveries. The company now claims the All-Wheel Drive model will be delivered to customers between August and September 2024 and the Cyberbeast between October and December 2024\. The All-Wheel Drive trim offers two motors for up to 100 horsepower, and the Cyberbeast is a tri-motor version of the truck.

 Tesla has already issued four recalls for the Cybertruck, due to its [faulty accelerator pedal assembly](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-recalls-all-3878-cybertrucks-over-faulty-accelerator-pedal-cover/), a [software bug](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V051-2023.PDF), a [part falling off](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/tesla-recalls-cybertruck-to-fix-wiper-motor-and-piece-that-may-fly-off-the-car/), and a [broken motor in the windshield wiper](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/tesla-recalls-cybertruck-to-fix-wiper-motor-and-piece-that-may-fly-off-the-car/). It doesn't seem like a great idea to spend at least $100,000 on a poorly-built truck that [could harm you and the people around you](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cybertruck-accelerator-stuck-driving-issue-tesla-recall-musk-rcna147832). There are many other options for an electric car or truck at this point.
