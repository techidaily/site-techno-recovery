## Fast Track Anonymity: Master the Art of Hiding Your Internet Identity Today

Trying to surf the Internet securely and anonymously? Hiding your IP address is an important way to protect your privacy on the Internet. And in fact, doing this is very easy. The following are the ways that have helped many Internet users hide their IP addresses…

## Try these methods

You may not have to try them all; just choose the right one for you.

1. [**Connect to a VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Use the Tor browser**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Connect to a VPN

 This is the most convenient way of hiding your IP address. Your connection to the Internet will go through a VPN (Virtual Private Network) server, which masks your IP address (the server’s address will be shown instead).

 There are two ways you can use a VPN. The first one is**set up your own VPN server** , and connect your computer to that server. You should have a server (or at least a normal computer) at a different location from your home. And the process of configuring the connection requires some advanced computer skills.

 The second and easier one is to**use a VPN service** . We recommend using**NordVPN** . NordVPN helps you set up a fast, stable and secure Internet connection to anywhere. And it helps you do this with just a few clicks!

 You can get a decent deal for the**NordVPN services** . Check out the **[NordVPN coupons](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  here!

### Method 2: Use the Tor browser

 You can also use the Tor browser to hide your IP address. This is a free and open project that helps you protect your privacy. Your Internet activities are taken through its anonymous and secure network, which makes it difficult for others to know your information, including your IP address.

 The Tor browser may decrease your Internet connection speed because of its secure multi-node network structure. You may not be able to use the Internet as fast and conveniently as on a normal browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox.

 To use the Tor browser, simply go the **[its website](https://www.torproject.org/)**  , then download and install the browser on your computer. After that, follow its instruction to configure the browser, and you should be able to use it to browse the Internet safely.

 Hopefully one of the methods above helped you hide your IP address. If you have any questions or suggestions, you’re more than welcome to leave us a comment below.
