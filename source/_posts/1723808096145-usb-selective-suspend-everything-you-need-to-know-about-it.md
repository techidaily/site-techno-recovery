## Part 1: What is USB selective suspend?

**The tl;dr version**: it prevents your computer from using too much unnecessary power by putting certain USB port(s) in a low-power state, i.e. the suspend state. USB selective suspend feature only works when you have USB devices connected to your computer, and that you have the most recent correct drivers for your USB ports. (Not sure if you have the most recent correct USB device drivers? Use[**Driver Easy Free**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)to find out! üòâ ) USB devices such as webcams, printers, and scanners are not in active use every minute of the day. To reduce the overall power consumption, especially if you‚Äôre a laptop or tablet user, Windows will automatically put a certain USB port that is not in use in a low-power state. This is one of the ways how Windows avoid data loss and driver corruption in devices such as external hard drives. That said, you‚Äôll have more power available from idle external devices, and your actively in use USB devices won‚Äôt be affected. This is where the ‚Äúselective‚Äù comes. It comes really handy for laptop and tablet users, especially when you don‚Äôt have a charger plugged in. Not to worry that your idle keyboard and mouse device will be suspended, because if you have enabled Wake from Keyboard/Mouse option in BIOS settings, which is usually the case with most of the computers, these two basic devices are filtered out. Such being the case, if Windows detects that none of your USB devices are in active use, it will first suspend accordant USB ports, and then go to the sleep or hibernate mode, to reduce your power consumption. In other words, if some of your USB ports are not suspended, your Windows is not likely to be able to go to the sleep or hibernate mode. Because some of your devices keep running somewhere.

## Part 2: Should I disable USB selective suspend or enable it?

You should choose to leave it enable or disable it as per your own needs.

### Why should I enable it?

As mentioned, the USB selective suspend is really handy for laptop and tablet users in that it saves you power from unnecessary USB devices. So if you have not experienced any problems with your external USB devices on your laptop or tablet, you should leave it be.

### Why should I disable it?

Frankly speaking, the USB selective suspend feature is not entirely helpful for desktop users, since desktops are always plugging into the power cord. But it won‚Äôt hurt either just to leave it at the enable state.
