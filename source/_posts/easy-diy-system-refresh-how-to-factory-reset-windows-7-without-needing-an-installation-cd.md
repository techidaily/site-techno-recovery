## Success Story: Navigating Past Windows 11 Install Problems and Winning

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-10_15-19-07.png)

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error is one of the most reported errors that users get when they try to install Windows 10\. If you also encounter this exact error and have no clue what to do, you’ve come to the right place. In this post, we’ll walk you through the steps to fix the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

* [1: Remove the peripheral devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [2: Clear an attribute of $WINDOWS.~BT installation folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3: Uninstall the language pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [4: Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [5: Perform a clean boot installation](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [6: Repair corrupted system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Bonus tip: how to keep your PC at top condition](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1: Remove the peripheral devices

 The first quick fix you can try is to**unplug any unnecessary peripheral devices from your PC** and try to install Windows 10 again. For example, scanners, printers, a secondary monitor, speakers, etc. When any of these devices uses a generic driver, it may interfere with the installation and cause the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error.

 If the installation proceeds and turns out successful, you can plug the devices back in after your system gets updated. But if this doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Clear an attribute of $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error could be triggered when the installer tries to repeatedly copy the files in a certain folder. You can try to clear an attribute of the $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder to see if it solves your problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**E** to open the File Explorer, and navigate to the**C drive** .
2. From the toolbar, click**View** and make sure you tick the checkbox of**Hidden items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_11-22-46.png)
3. You should find the**$WINDOWS.\~BT** folder here. Right-click it and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_11-24-21.png)
4. Uncheck the checkbox of**Read-Only** , then click**Apply** and**OK** .

## Fix 4: Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data

#### On Windows 10/8

1. Press the**Windows key** , search for**recovery** , then click**Recovery options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_17-10-46.png)

#### On Windows 7

1. Restart your PC. When you see the manufacturer logo, keep pressing the**F8** key to enter the Advanced Boot Options screen.
2. Use the arrow keys to select**Safe Mode with Command Prompt** , then press**Enter** .

 Once you’ve opened the Command Prompt window, follow the steps below:

1. In the Command Prompt window, type in the following command lines. Make sure you**press Enter after every command line** and wait for it to complete.  

` **bootrec /RebuildBcd**  
 **bootrec /fixMbr**  
 **bootrec /fixboot** `
2. Close the Command Prompt window, and click**Continue** to exit to your desktop.
3. Run the installer again to test the issue.

## Fix 5: Perform a clean boot installation

 Sometimes the programs on your PC may interfere with Windows installation. If you’ve got a specific error code, it’s likely due to an incompatible software or driver. Removing the problematic software or[updating your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) may solve the problem.

 But when that doesn’t help or you don’t have an error code, then you may run a clean boot installation to identify the cause and fix the problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows ke** y, type**msconfig** in the search bar, and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-14-09-1.png)
2. Under the**General** tab, choose**Selective startup** , and make sure**the checkbox of Load startup items is unticked** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-24-57.png)
3. Go to the**Boot** tab,**untick the checkbox of Safe boot** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-17-16.png)
4. Under the**Services** tab, choose**Hide all microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-18-39.png)
5. Switch to the**Startup** tab, click**Open Task Manager** .  
 (If you’re on Windows 7, right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar to find the option of task manager.)

6. Under the**Startup** tab, select every enabled startup item and click**Disable** until you’ve disabled all startup items.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-48-33.jpg)
7. Restart your PC and try to run the Windows installer.

## Fix 6: Repair corrupted system files

## Bonus tip: how to keep your PC in top condition

 Outdated or faulty drivers may trigger this error, although not very common.

But in general, keeping your device drivers up-to-date can help prevent and solve many random computer issues.

 There are two ways to keep your drivers up-to-date. One is to update the drivers via Device Manager. You may have to manually check every device and update them when Windows detects available updates.
