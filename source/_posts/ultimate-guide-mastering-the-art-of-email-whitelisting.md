 The safelisting procedure differs slightly different from one email service to the next.

## Gmail Safelist Procedure

 There is no quick checkbox in Gmail to add a sender email to an actual list of friends you want to keep out of the spam box. However, there are several effective ways to[safelist your friends in Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-safelist-a-sender-or-domain-in-gmail-1172106) .

### Add Email Addresses to Contacts

[Open your contacts list in Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-and-access-gmail-contacts-1171950) . The fastest method is just to visit the[Google Contacts link](https://contacts.google.com) .

 Sometimes, a friend may send you an email that ends up in the Spam box before you've had a chance to safelist their email address. There's a quick way to fix that as well.

## Comcast Email Safelist

 Comcast, otherwise branded as Xfinity, is one of the most popular Internet Service Providers in the country. For this reason, many people may need to safelist their friends using that service.

 An even faster way to safelist emails of all of your friends is to import contacts from your other accounts.

 When you click on**Address Book** , you'll see an**Import contacts** link in the left navigation pane. Click**Get Started** , and walk through the wizard to import existing contacts from your other accounts like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or even a text file.

### Add a Safelist Email Filter

 Like Gmail and Yahoo, the best way to safelist friends in your Xfinity email account is to create a filter that guarantees the incoming email will go to your Inbox.

1. Select the**gear icon** in the upper right corner and click or tap**Settings** .  
![Screenshot of settings in Xfinity Mail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tke3_qVbfBAj1Bln8C1VQEyBr7E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-whitelist-email-addresses-4588603-12-90e7b9f373a942fa9c48ba689d8a89f2.png)
2. Select**Filter Rules** , under**Mail** in the left navigation pane, then the**Add New Rule** button.  
![Screenshot of adding new rules in Xfinity Mail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BMW04b_pPIGnrxmniem2hRonO3E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-whitelist-email-addresses-4588603-13-81a16660f1a6477a8b63fe32782a6b90.png)
3. Make the**Rule Name** your friend's name. Select**Add condition** and choose**Sender/From** . In the**Contains** field, type the email address or domain to safelist.  
![Screenshot of adding a new rule in Xfinity Mail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cV8hZYQypsP8f_uC_foBaC9AJGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-whitelist-email-addresses-4588603-14-1426ce02076f40afb18ce38b2061b717.png)
4. Select the**Add action** link then**Keep** . Save the new rule.  
![Screenshot of adding an action to a rule in Xfinity Mail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1fva1KXb-V0T_udxD2-N05IJKZo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-whitelist-email-addresses-4588603-15-c756a2d751b54284af99321e42bdb8c6.png)
5. Once you're done, you'll see your new filter show up under**Mail Filter Rules** in Xfinity Mail settings.

 By choosing "Keep", you're ensuring that incoming emails from that domain or email address will land in your inbox.

### Email Safe List

 In**Settings** , if you select**Advanced Settings** under Mail in the left navigation pane, you'll see a section titled**Email Safe list** .

 If you enable**Use email safe list** , only emails that are on your email safe list will show up in your inbox. Every other incoming email will be discarded.

 This appproach is ideal if you're only looking to use your Xfinity email account to communicate with a limited set of people. However, enabling this feature prevents anyone else from ever being able to send you an email.

 This may be a great way to eliminate all forms of spam, but it also drastically reduces the usefulness of your email account.
