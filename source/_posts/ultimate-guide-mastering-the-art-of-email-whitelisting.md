5. Once you're done, you'll see your new filter show up under**Mail Filter Rules** in Xfinity Mail settings.

 By choosing "Keep", you're ensuring that incoming emails from that domain or email address will land in your inbox.

### Email Safe List

 In**Settings** , if you select**Advanced Settings** under Mail in the left navigation pane, you'll see a section titled**Email Safe list** .

 If you enable**Use email safe list** , only emails that are on your email safe list will show up in your inbox. Every other incoming email will be discarded.

 This appproach is ideal if you're only looking to use your Xfinity email account to communicate with a limited set of people. However, enabling this feature prevents anyone else from ever being able to send you an email.

 This may be a great way to eliminate all forms of spam, but it also drastically reduces the usefulness of your email account.
