## Guide: Preventing Unwanted Windows 11 Updates Without Hitches

Windows 10 computers automatically search for and download any updates it is offered by Windows Update. This feature could be good to some users, but it could also be a headache to many others, especially when Windows Update install some faulty updates that are causing bigger problem than just let the computer stays outdated.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/windows-updates.png)
  
 To prevent Windows 10 from automatically downloading updates that you don’t want, here are some options that you could try.
  
[**Option One: Meter your Internet connection**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Option Two: Disable automatic driver updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Option Three: Schedule restart time**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Option Four: Installing updates and drivers by using Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
  
 Please select accordingly the option that works for you.
  
 **Option One: Meter your Internet connection**
  
 Using a metered Internet connection is the easiest way to prevent Windows 10 from installing or getting the updates automatically.
  
 If you are connecting to the Internet via**wireless connection** , here is how you can meter your Internet connection.
  
 1) Follow the step: **Start button > Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi** . On the right side of the pane, click the name of your Wi-Fi connection.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/start-button-settings-network-internet-wi-fi-600x477.png)
  
 2) In the new opened window, scroll down a little bit to locate the option**Set as metered connection** , then set it as**On** .

 If you are connecting to the Internet via Ethernet, Windows 10 seems to assume that you have unlimited data usage. But if you want to update Windows 10 at your own pace, meaning that you manually download an update on a metered connection. Here is how you can do it.
  
 Follow the step: **Start button > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update** . Then**Check for updates** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/start-button-settings-update-security-windows-update.jpg)

 If found any, just press the**Download** button to get them downloaded and installed.
  
 If you want to change the setting so that even when you are using Ethernet Windows 10 will not update automatically, you need to delve into the Registry Editor to make some changes. But messing around with your Registry could break your computer. So we do not recommend you do that here.
  
 **Option Two: Disable automatic driver updates**
  
 1) Click the**Start** button and then choose**Control Panel** (View by**Small icon** ). Then go to**System** .

 2) On the left pane, choose**Advanced system settings** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/advanced-system-settings.jpg)

 3) In the System Properties window, go to**Hardware** tab, then click**Device Installation Settings** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/device-installation-settings.jpg)

 4) When prompted with the message, click**No (your device might not work as expected)** and click**Save Changes** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no-your-device-might-not-work-as-expected.jpg)
  
 **Option Three: Schedule restart time**
  
 If you don’t mind the automatic updates from Windows, but you do mind the auto restart coming along with the update, especially when you are in the middle of something. You can follow the steps below to set a 12-hour window in which your computer won’t automatically reboot.
  
 1) Follow the path:**Start** button**\> Update & security > Windows Update** . On the right side of the pane to choose**Change active hours** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/change-active-hours.jpg)

 2) You can set the times you don’t want Windows to automatically update and restart. After the change, click the**Save** button to save the change.

 **Option Four: Installing updates and drivers by using Driver Easy**
  
 Windows 10 is known to be capable to bring faulty drivers or update patches to your computer which could cause some issues, sometimes irrecoverable issues to your computer.
