## How did we choose these headphone deals?

We went looking for these deals as if we were shopping for ourselves. By using discount codes and extensions, as well as looking through retailers' websites, these were the best headphone deals we could find for products the whole ZDNET team would enjoy. 

We focused on:

* **Price**: Naturally, we wanted to ensure that each product is a good deal, no matter your budget.
* **Rarity of sales**: Some products -- such as Apple devices -- are rarely on sale. While the discounts are often small, they should be highlighted when they appear.
* **Features**: We included headphones with a range of features including active noise cancellation, voice assistant support, and different audio settings.
* **Type**: We wanted to include a variety of headphones suitable for different needs. For example, you may want a robust pair of over-ear headphones suitable for work, or you may prefer earbuds for exercise and the daily commute.

## What is better -- over-ear or in-ear headphones?

If you're still deciding between over-ear and in-ear headphones, consider how you plan to use them. If you want to use your headphones during exercise, for example, earbuds might suit you better. However, if you want to wear them to block out noisy environments -- such as in coffee shops or while traveling -- or you need them to accept work calls, the improved noise insulation provided by over-ear products is your best bet.

## Do expensive headphones sound better?

This entirely depends on the manufacturer. You should expect to pay more if headphones include dedicated processors, active noise cancellation, Bluetooth, wireless technologies, hands-free calling, and other useful features. Furthermore, style comes into play: headphones with metal bands and leather cups will fetch a higher price than plastic. 

## Who makes the best budget headphones?

Many headphone manufacturers today attempt to develop ranges for all kinds of budgets. While you're unlikely to find headphones created by the likes of Bose, Apple, or Sennheiser for less than a hundred bucks, you should consider Sony, Jabra, Skullcandy, and JBL.
