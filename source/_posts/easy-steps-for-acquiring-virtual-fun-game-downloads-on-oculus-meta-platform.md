##  How to Buy Games for Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 

 The Quest 2 has a built-in storefront you can access in VR, so you can buy games, download them, and jump right into the action without taking off your headset.

 The mobile app also includes the same storefront, which allows you to browse Quest 2 games at your leisure when you aren’t in VR, make purchases, and queue games for download.

 If you buy a Quest 2 game through the mobile app store, it will download the next time you turn on your headset and connect it to the internet.

 The Oculus desktop app also has a storefront, but it’s focused on Rift and Rift S games. You can buy games through that app and play them when your Quest 2 is tethered to a VR-ready PC, but you won’t be able to play them on an untethered Quest 2 unless it specifies in the game details that it's cross-buy compatible.

##  What Is Oculus Quest Cross Buy? 

 Cross buy is a feature that lets you buy certain games one time and then play them in both tethered and untethered mode.

 When you buy a game in the Quest 2 store, you typically only get access to the Quest 2 version of the game. Similarly, when you buy a game from the Oculus desktop app store, you typically only get access to the desktop version of the game, which you can play with a Rift, Rift S, or tethered Quest 2.

 If a game is marked cross buy, you can buy it on the Quest 2 store and also get access to the desktop version, or buy it through the desktop app and also get access to the Quest 2 version.

[ Meta maintains a list of cross buy games](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/section/2335732183153590/) , but the safest way to make sure a game will actually work on your Quest 2 is to buy it through the Quest 2 store in VR or the mobile app with Quest/Quest 2 selected as the active headset.
