##  Automatic Captions on Instagram

 Some people don't add captions to their Instagram stories. To see captions on those stories, you will need to enable automatic captions.

 The feature is automatically enabled on some devices, but others will have to enable this feature using the steps above. Captions increase accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing, but there are other benefits to captions.

 Consider using captions if:

* You watch videos in a non-native language
* You are practicing reading, regardless of language
* Your comprehension is helped by reading
* You use Instagram without volume

 FAQ

* How long are Instagram captions allowed to be?  
 Instagram captions max out at 2,200 characters, which is roughly between 300 and 500 words.
* How do I write good Instagram captions?  
 Some suggestions for more engaging captions include an attention-grabbing first sentence, a call to action or question for viewers, and approaching it like telling a story. You can also[ use lists for inspiration](https://www.lifewire.com/best-instagram-captions-4171697) .
