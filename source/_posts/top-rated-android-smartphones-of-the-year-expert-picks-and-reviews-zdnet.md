## Top-Rated Android Smartphones of the Year: Expert Picks & Reviews - ZDNet

As a smartphone reviewer, I spend an unhealthy amount of time testing apps, making phone calls, and snapping way too many food photos with [the latest phones on the market](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/). I am basically best friends with my SIM card ejector, and I say that proudly.

Among all the options from Android makers like [Samsung](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/), Google, and OnePlus, I've developed a good sense of which ones are truly worth your hard-earned money. That includes buying advice for the latest Google Pixel 9 series, which features not one, not two, but four new models to evaluate.

* Reliable quad-camera setup

Cons

### Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra

#### Best Android phone overall

Samsung's latest Galaxy S24 line is the first to go all-in on AI, and the S24 Ultra, the most premium of the three, is the best Android phone today. The new Galaxy AI model embedded in the device brings a host of generative capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, the ability to circle an object on screen to perform an image-based Google search, AI-assisted photo editing and transcriptions, and even a Chat Assist feature for figuring out how to phrase a message in different tones.

Like its predecessor, the S23 Ultra, the S24 Ultra is built with a large 6.8-inch AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. Though the price has gone up to $1,299 ($100 more than the S23 Ultra), the phone's upgrades make it well worth it: The S24 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame, compared to last year's aluminum, and features Corning's latest Gorilla Armor. 

**Review:** [**Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review/)

The difference in display protection means the S24 Ultra is more glare-free than ever, which ZDNET reviewer Jason Hiner suggested: "makes its screen more enjoyable to use than the iPhone 15 Pro Max and other flagship phones." Reddit users seem to agree with Hiner, including one who said he believes "the anti-reflective glass _really_ makes a difference."

Under the hood, the S24 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset for improved graphics and AI features, 12GB RAM (an increase from last year's 8GB), and 2,600 nits of brightness -- a big improvement over last year's 1,750\. As for the new camera system, the big upgrade comes in the form of a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. As Hiner discovered, the results were sharper and less noisy images and an overall camera system that could pull in more light than ever before.

**Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra specs:** **Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | **Display size:** 6.8 inches | **Storage options:** Up to 1TB | **Rear cameras:** 200MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto (5x), 10MP telephoto (3x) | **Front camera:** 12MP | **Battery:** 5,000mAh

Pros 
* Quality cameras all across the board
* Plenty of useful AI features
* Up to 5,060mAh battery with LTPO display
* Arguably the best front-facing camera on any phone

Cons 
* Stock Android can feel too minimal
* Capped at 45W fast charging
* Costs $100 more than last year's model

### Google Pixel 9 Pro

#### Best camera Android phone

When it comes to camera performance, you can't go wrong with any of the flagship devices from the big three (Apple, Samsung, and Google). Depending on your preference for color temperature and feature set, you may lean towards one manufacturer over the other. But more often than not, Google's Pixel camera system satisfies most users, and the latest Pixel 9 Pro (and Pro XL) remains a champion for instant capturing and post-processing. 

Both sizes of the latest model feature a reliable triple lens setup, with a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens for far-distance shots. They're backed by numerous software features like Google's Super Res Zoom (for up to 30x zoom photos), 8K video upscaling, and a new Add Me feature that lets you snap and merge two photos so everyone can be in the same shot. There's also a new 42MP selfie camera that's sharper and captures a wider FOV than last year's 10.8MP sensor. That should play well with group selfies and scenic shots.

**Review**: **[Google Pixel 9 Pro hands-on](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-every-google-pixel-9-model-and-this-is-the-one-you-should-buy/)**

Again, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile photography; there's also post-processing and the flexibility of devices with editing and tweaking subjects. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro, powered by a new Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take that can turn any bad photo into a good one.

All in all, the Pixel 9 Pro has one of the most versatile camera systems on the market, with an output that's balanced in color and generally satisfying to look at.

**Google Pixel 9 Pro** **tech specs: Processor:** Google Tensor G4 | **Display size:** 6.3 and 6.7 inches | **Storage options:** 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP telephoto | **Front camera:** 42MP | **Battery:** 4,700/5,060mAh

Pros 
* Doubles as a tablet
* Large 7.8-inch, 120Hz, OLED panel
* Intuitive multitasking capabilities
* Lightweight and comfortable design

Cons 
* No wireless charging
* Lack of official water and dust resistance

### OnePlus Open

#### Best foldable Android phone

The number of foldable phones on the market has never been higher, thanks to the collective effort of every manufacturer, including Google with its Pixel Fold, Motorola with its Razr lineup, and OnePlus with the OnePlus Open. While Samsung has held the reins of the best foldable honor for years, and the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold remains to be tested, I'm giving the top spot to the OnePlus Open right now. 

Unlike its competitors, the OnePlus Open strikes the best balance of weight-to-size ratio. When folded, the phone is as light as an iPhone, and when unfolded, it expands into a thin slate of visual goodness. OnePlus leverages the 7.8-inch display by offering some of the most intuitive multitasking features I've tested, headlined by "Open Canvas." With it, you can open up to three apps at once, and as you tap into each one, the other one or two will tuck itself to the side, ready to reappear when needed.

**Review:** [**OnePlus Open**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-first-ever-foldable-makes-samsung-and-googles-look-outdated-and-its-near-perfect/)

While presented in a casing that stands out more, the triple camera setup captures spectacular photos and videos, emphasizing the blue orangish hues that cinematographers and photography buffs know and love. The foldable form factor also allows the Open to take hands-free selfies and group photos.

OnePlus got the fundamentals down pat with the Open, too, including 65W fast charging capabilities (with a charger in the box) that blow past Samsung's Z Fold 5 and Google's Pixel Fold standards, a _base_ configuration of 16GB RAM and 512GB storage, and a crease-less inner display. The cherry on top for me is its $1,699 price tag. One Amazon customer even says the Open was a surprisingly smooth entryway into Android "after going with just iPhones since the iPhone 7."

**OnePlus Open** **tech specs: Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 | **Display size:** 6.3 (outer) and 7.8 inches (inner) | **Storage options:** 512GB | **Rear cameras:** 48MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 64MP telephoto | **Front camera:** 32MP (outer) 20MP and (inner)

Pros 
* Competitively priced at under $500
* Bright and smooth 120Hz OLED display
* Seven years of operating system updates
* Plenty of Android AI features, with more to come

Cons 
* Lack of dedicated telephoto lens
* 6.1-inch screen may be too small for some users
* Wired charging capped at 18W

### Google Pixel 8a

#### Best budget Android phone

If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Google Pixel 8a. There are three key reasons why you should buy the latest Pixel over any other mid-range phone: For $499, you get a comfortable 6.1-inch OLED display that ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, a reliable 64MP camera system, and Google's catalog of AI features like Magic Editor, Audio Eraser, and Gemini, all backed by seven years of operating system updates.

Software is the name of the game with Google Pixel phones, and the extensive support provided for the 8a series, powered by a new Tensor G3 chip, should keep it feature-relevant for as long as until 2031\. For reference, most phones in this price range, including last year's Pixel 7a, typically receive two to four years of software and security updates.

**Review:** [**Google Pixel 8a**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-compared-the-google-pixel-8a-with-every-major-sub-500-android-phone-heres-my-buying-advice/)

Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range, such as the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens and a slower wired charging rate (18W). However, from my hands-on time with the Pixel 8a, I found it just as capable of capturing various subjects and styles, and the presence of wireless charging makes up for the phone taking a few minutes longer to fully charge than flagship handsets. A significant drawback of the 8a is its charging speed, which, at only 18W, is slower than competing devices, several Reddit users have mentioned.

**Google Pixel 8a tech specs: Processor:** Google Tensor G3 | **Display size:** 6.1 inches | **Storage options:** 128GB, 256GB | **Rear cameras:** 64MP main, 13MP ultrawide| **Front camera:** 13MP

Pros 
* Glyph Interface is bold and practical to use
* Nothing OS 2.0 software is bloatware free
* All-day battery life
* Priced well

Cons 
* Slippery without a case
* No telephoto lens
* No Verizon support

### Nothing Phone 2

#### Best design Android phone

Nothing is easily the hottest Android maker in recent years, with a flashy transparent design language that tugs the heartstrings of retro-tech enthusiasts. It's also one of the few (if not only) new entrants in the smartphone market, joining the fray at a time when [others have pulled out](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-is-ending-its-smartphone-business/).

Fortunately, Nothing Phone 2, the company's successor to Nothing Phone 1, brings the sizzle and the substance to back it up. Powering the phone is an improved Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor with up to 12GB of RAM, which -- from ZDNET's testing -- proved to be more than enough for Nothing's minimalist and digital wellbeing-focused software experience. One Reddit user pointed out that the Nothing Phone 2 "runs smoothly and the battery is extraordinary."

**Review:** [**Nothing Phone 2**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nothing-phone-2-hands-on-review/)

The key selling point of the Phone 2 is what Nothing calls Glyph Interface, an assembly of LED strips on the back of the phone that blinks in unique patterns depending on incoming alerts and notifications. It's a clever way to leverage the transparent back panel, encouraging users to stare at their phone screens less. Bold design philosophy, I know.

For $549, the Nothing Phone 2 undercuts most flagships on the market today, like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and OnePlus 12, while offering a reliably charming smartphone package that most design freaks and fashionistas will adore.

**Nothing Phone 2 tech specs: Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 | **Display size:** 6.7 inches | **Storage options:** 128GB/256GB/512GB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide | **Front camera:** 32MP

Pros 
* Snappy and smooth performance
* 80W fast-charging (and 50W wireless) with charger in the box
* Premium build quality for the price
* Competitive main camera for photos

Cons 
* IP65 rating is not as water resistant as flagship phones
* Curved glass/frame design can be slippery for some
* Video recording is not the best

### OnePlus 12

#### Best fast-charging Android phone

OnePlus has had its ups and downs over the past four years, pivoting from value-driven smartphones to ultra-premium and back to square one with last year's OnePlus 11\. This year, it's doubling down on its value-driven flagships.

The OnePlus 12 starts at $899, which undercuts its closest competitors, the $999 Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro, and here's everything you get for the price: a large 6.8-inch AMOLED 120Hz display, a 5,400mAh battery, a triple camera setup with a competent 50MP main lens at the helm, the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and more. Again: $899, and that's before the $100 discount when you trade in any phone in any condition to OnePlus. Take advantage of that.

**Review:** [**OnePlus 12**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-reasons-why-im-sold-on-the-oneplus-12-and-1-reason-for-buyers-remorse/)

Putting the value aspect aside, the OnePlus 12 shines with its charging speed, something you'll quickly take for granted once you realize that phones don't have to sit by an outlet for two hours every day. The phone's 80W wired charging can power it from 0 to 50% within 10 minutes. A full charge takes less than 30 minutes. "80W fast charging is life-changing," a satisfied Best Buy customer adds.

Just as impressive is the OnePlus 12's new 50W wireless charging, a feature many users have been asking for and was sorely missed on last year's model. While the OnePlus 12 is not as "all in" on generative AI features, it offers a well-rounded, high-performing Android experience for a couple of hundred dollars less than other flagship phones.

**OnePlus 12** **tech specs: Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | **Display size:** 6.8 inches | **Storage options:** 256GB/512GB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 64MP telephoto | **Front camera:** 32MP

Pros 
* 6.78-inch OLED display ramps up to 165Hz
* 5,500mAh battery with 65W charging
* Included cooling fan doubles as a subwoofer

Cons 
* Software experience can feel cluttered
* May not support your carrier network
* Pricey, all things said and done

### Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro

#### Best gaming Android phone

If there's one area in which Android completely dominates iOS, it's gaming. Whether you game on existing mobile apps or take to the cloud for streaming, Android manufacturers have spent the past decade forging a new category of gaming-tailored smartphones, and the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro may just be the best in its class. 

Here's a rundown of its key gaming features: The phone has a 165Hz refresh rate display for buttery-smooth visuals, 16GB of RAM, the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset to power through games and background tasks, capacitive side triggers that are mappable to various in-game functions, an additional LED back panel that one Reddit user says is "screaming my name," and a 5,500mAh battery keeping the lights turned on. It's a mouthful, I know.

The latest model also features various AI tools, like a wallpaper generator, to suit your theming preferences. For gamers, the phone supports X Sense 2.0, which uses AI to learn your in-game patterns so that the phone can automatically perform tasks for you, such as picking up objects as you move around in Genshin Impact. I tested several of these AI features at CES earlier this year and was impressed with how naturally Asus had embedded them into the phone's software.

But perhaps the most essential addition to this year's ROG Phone, and it's bizarre to think that there's more to all the madness above, is the bundled AeroActive Cooler. On the surface level, it's a cooling fan that snaps onto the back cover of the device. When turned on, a small vent opens from the phone, allowing any internal heat to ventilate. The cooler doubles as a subwoofer for enhanced audio output and has extra buttons to give you more controls when in-game.

**Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro** **tech specs:** **Processor**: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | **Display size:** 6.78 inches | **Storage options:** 512GB/1TB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP main, 13MP ultrawide | **Front camera:** 32MP

### Samsung Z Flip 6

#### Best compact Android phone

The new Galaxy Z Flip 6, unveiled at [Samsung Unpacked](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-watch-samsung-unpacked-paris-2024-and-what-were-expecting-to-be-unveiled/) in July, packs a ton of character and features into a tiny clamshell that pays homage to flip phones of the past.

Shape-shifting displays aside, the Z Flip 6 is very similar to the standard Samsung Galaxy S-series flagship, with a large 6.7-inch AMOLED panel that's crisp and bright, up to 512GB of RAM for those high-resolution pictures and videos, and a healthy 4,000mAh battery powering it all -- an upgrade from the Z Flip 5\. There's also now a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and the first vapor cooling chamber ever on a Z Flip device, both of which should make the phone run more efficiently, reducing battery drainage. The phone is thinner and lighter than previous models, too.

The Z Flip 6's camera system gets a nice boost, too, with an improved 50MP main sensor and 12MP ultra-wide. You'll also find a new AI-powered Auto Zoom feature, which automatically detects how many people are in a frame and potential background objects the user may want to keep in the shot and repositions them digitally. 

The Flex Window, or outer display of the flip phone, also gets some fun new features in the Z Flip 6, including interactive wallpapers, suggested replies to text messages, and a new Interpreter Mode for live translations.

## Which is the right Android phone for you?

All of these phones run the same base operating system, but the user interface ranges from stock Android to more elaborate options. First, you need to figure out which fits your needs best.

Camera performance across the board is solid for just about every phone on the list, but some are better than others. If you plan to capture photos as your primary function, then you should look to Google, Samsung, or even OnePlus.

If you plan to spend $1,000 or more, then you may also want your phone to last for at least a couple of years. You should consider companies with a good track record of regular updates, notably Google and Samsung, who currently promise seven years of software support.

## Factors to consider when choosing an Android phone

We chose these smartphones by testing the phones for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos. 

ZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the Android pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for.

* **Display**: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best Android phones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET put an emphasis on the devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.
* **Performance**: Most Android devices are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipsets, and we've found its more recent offerings very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services. When you have a task at hand, the best Android phones above are more than able to get the job done.
* **Camera quality**: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best Android phones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.
* **Battery life**: For how reliant we've become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but support fast charging when it's time to top up.
* **Price**: What you won't find on this list is a device that's not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you're getting.

## How we test Android phones

ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major Android release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:

* **Design and ergonomics:** How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.
* **Performance:** Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.
* **Camera quality:** ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.
* **Battery life and charging:** It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).
* **Special features:** These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.
* **Pricing and availability:** Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.

## What is the best brand for Android phones?

The beauty of Android is that you have options a lot of options. So the answer to "Which brand is best?" depends on your feature, user interface, and design preference. If you prefer a more minimalistic approach to hardware and software, Google's Pixel line will serve you best. If you want everything but the kitchen sink in a smartphone, go with Samsung. For more unique value propositions like ultra-fast charging and a smooth interface, give OnePlus phones a try.

Budget is also worth considering, but today, every major manufacturer, including Google and Samsung, offers Android phones in every price category (budget, mid-range, and premium,) so it won't be your biggest decider.

## What is the most reliable smartphone brand?

In the grand scheme, Apple is the most reliable smartphone brand, with the longest, most consistent aftersales support of all manufacturers. If we're looking at Android makers only, then Samsung would take the crown, with a promise of up to seven years of software updates for its latest phones, expansive carrier support across the U.S. (and overseas), and one of the most reliable repair and insurance infrastructures.

## Which Android version is best?

The latest version of Android is 99% of the time also the best version. At the moment, that's Android 14, which emphasizes enhanced security and privacy settings.

## What is better, an iPhone or an Android?

Customizability remains one of the biggest vantage points of Android, even though Apple has done a commendable job over the past two to three iOS versions to give its users more autonomy. You can also expect Android phones to support the most innovative features in the mobile industry, like foldable displays and faster USB-C charging. The caveat of being more experimental is that Android phones are generally not as consistent and reliable as iPhones.

On the flip side, iPhones are notorious for their stability and ease of use. If you're not one to tinker with your gadgets, then you'll fit right into the iOS ecosystem. Features like iMessage and FaceTime are also key differentiators when comparing iPhones to Android. Those two features alone can dictate your decision.

## Can I use eSIM on an Android phone?

While Apple's iPhone 14 made headlines for its [eSIM integration](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-worst-thing-about-esim-only-iphone-14s/), the digital service also works -- and has been for some time -- with Android devices, including the latest Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, and OnePlus smartphone. As always, it's best practice to consult with your local carrier before [converting to eSIM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-esim-how-to-transfer-your-phone-number-to-apples-newest-iphone/). 

## What is the best small Android phone?

Besides the Motorola Razr Plus, the [Samsung Galaxy S24](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review/) is a worthy runner-up, with only a 6.2-inch AMOLED display, up to 512GB of storage, and a flat-edge design that makes it all the easier to manage with one hand. During ZDNET's testing, the small-but-mighty Android proved capable of handling apps and services typically run on larger devices.

## Other Android phones we tested

Outside of this list of excellent options, here are worthy alternatives that will surely delight you.
