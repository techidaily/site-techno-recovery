## My AirPods aren't resetting. What should I do?

You need to have both AirPods fully connected inside the case for the reset to happen. If you have an AirPod with a faulty connection, it might take a few trials to get it connected inside the case. If that doesn't work, consider [cleaning your case](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-clean-and-sanitize-your-airpods/) to get rid of any dirt or dust in the way of the connection.

## How can I reset my AirPods Max?

The AirPods Max don't have a case, so the steps for resetting them are different than that of the earbud AirPods. You should charge them for 10 minutes before beginning the reset. Once they're charged, press and hold the noise control button and the Digital Crown until the light flashes amber. Go to your Bluetooth settings to reset your AirPods Max, and wait for the amber light to turn white.

## What happens once my AirPods are reset?

The AirPods won't instantly recognize your device and pair with it. The reset gives your AirPods a blank slate for [connecting to iOS devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-connect-airpods-to-iphone-and-just-about-any-other-device/).
