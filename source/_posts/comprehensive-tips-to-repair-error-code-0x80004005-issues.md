## How to Fix STOP 0x0000003D Errors

 This STOP code is rare, so there's little troubleshooting information available that's specific to the error. However, since most STOP errors have similar causes, there are some basic troubleshooting steps to help fix STOP 0x0000003D issues:

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't already done so. The STOP 0x0000003D blue screen error may not occur again after rebooting.
2. Did you just install or make a change to a device? If so, there's a good chance the change you made caused the error. Undo the change and test for the 0x3D blue screen error.  
 Depending on what changes were made, some solutions might include:  
   * Removing or reconfiguring the newly installed device  
   * [Starting up with Last Known Good Configuration](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-start-windows-7-using-last-known-good-configuration-2626308) to undo related [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) and driver changes  
   * [Using System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to undo recent changes  
   * [Rolling back the device driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to the version prior to your driver update
3. [Perform basic STOP error troubleshooting](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-blue-screen-of-death-2624518) . These extensive troubleshooting steps aren't specific to the STOP 0x0000003D error, but since most STOP errors are so similar, they should help resolve it.
