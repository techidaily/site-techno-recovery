![how to burn audible to cd easily](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/burn-audible-to-cd-easily.jpg)

Most people would like to burn audible to CD for backing up or just enjoying audible audiobooks on car DVD system or Home Hifi CD Player. But things are not so easy because most of Audible files are protected with DRM limitation, which prevents us copying or burning Audible into compact discs with the normal CD burner. In fact, this is also what I want to share with you in this guide. No matter whether your audible books has DRM or not, here I introduce 3 ways to burn Audible to CD easily and conveniently. 

* [Preparation: Download Audible files to computer first](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 1: Burn Audible to CD with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) (both PC and Mac)
* [Method 2: Burn Audible to CD with Audible Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) (PC only)
* [Method 3: Remove Audible DRM first and Burn with Any Common CD Burners](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) (highly recommended)

### Download Audible Files to Computer First

Before burning audible books to CD, firstly we should get the audiobooks downloaded well to the computer. 

Go to the [Audible library page](https://www.audible.com/lib) and select the files you want to download by clicking on "Download" button.

![download audible to computer before burning](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-option-on-audible-site.png)

Soon the AAXC/AAX files downloading begins. More info you can read the original article:[How to Download Audible Audiobooks to Computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Method 1: Burn Audible to CD with iTunes (PC/MAC) 

Audible has authorized iTunes to burn audible audiobooks to CD. So when asked how to burn audible book to cd, the top priority method is using iTunes. 

Heads up 

* For better working you'd better to upgrade your iTunes to the latest version.
* All Audible tracks can only be burned for one time.
* We can only burn audible to audio CD. We can't burn audible to MP3 CD which will be compatible with more players. This means that DVD or MP3 disc is not supported.
* We have to authorize Audible account in iTunes.

#### Step 1: Import Audible files to iTunes library. 

If you are using a Mac, the audible files should have been already in iTunes.

If you are on a Windows PC, and your audible files are downloaded with Audible app or Audible Manager, please click "iTunes" > "File" > "Library" > "Import Playlist" or "Add File to Library".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Please note that if your iTunes are not authorized with Audible account, you will receive a window after you adding audible audio books to library.

![authorize iTunes with audible account](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/authorize-itunes-with-audible-account.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Click on "Yes" then you will be guided to audible official site to activate the authorization.

If your audible books are downloaded with iTunes, just click on "Books" in the upper left corner of iTunes, and then "Audiobooks".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### Step 2: Create new playlist for the audible files.

Go to "Audiobooks" selection, right click at the audible audio book you want to burn to CD, and then choose "Add to Playlist" > "New Playlist".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If you can see an option "New Playlist from Selection", it's also OK to click it.

**Note:** You must create a new playlist for each file you burn. And the newly created list will be displayed in the ribbon in the left corner of iTunes. 

#### Step 3: Insert a blank CD and burn playlist to CD.

Insert a blank CD into the CD drive, wait for the computer to recognize it. 

Then just right click (CTRL+Click on Mac) the newly created audible playlist and choose "Burn Playlist to Disc".

![burn playlist to disc](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/burn-playlist-to-disc.png)

#### Step 4: Customize the burning settings.

You will be asked to adjust the burning settings, including the burn speed, disc format, etc..

| Burn Settings     | Recommended |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Preferred Speed   | 8x          |
| Disc Format       | Audio CD    |
| Gap Between Songs | None        |

Click "Burn" once you confirmed. If the added audible playlist is longer than 80 minutes, iTunes will prompt when you need to add a new CD, you just need to follow it to successfully complete the burn.

### Method 2: Burn Audible to CD with Audible Manager (PC Only)

Burning audible to cd without iTunes, you can also use CD burning plugin (such as, Nero, Roxio CD Burning) and activate it into audible manager. Mac is not allowed to use this way.

**Please note:**  The process of burning an audible audiobook with this method is not so easy because those plugins we installed from third-party stores sometimes will be incompatible with the Audible manager.

#### Step 1: Install Nero plugin.

[Download the Nero Burning ROM](https://filehippo.com/jp/download%5Fnero-burning-rom/) and install it to your computer please. 

**Tips:** Of course you can also use other cd burning plugin tools, for example, Roxio CD Burning.

#### Step 2: Activate Nero plugin on Audible Manager.

When the installation finished, your computer will restart. Then open Audible Manager (version 3.6 or higher) and activate the nero plugin (Go to CD Burn Mode). Ensure that you are connected to the Internet, and click on "Nero CD Burner" icon under "Mobile Devices". 

Then you can burn your audible files with Nero on your Windows. 

This audible official help document is recommended here: [CD burning with audible manager](http://download.audible.com/help/gettingstartedcdburn.pdf).

### Method 3: Remove Audible DRM First (Easiest Way)

Both methods introduced above limit us burning audible to cd windows media player, or burning audible to mp3 CD. In fact, nearly 95% of Audible files are protected with Audible DRM, which makes it impossible to back up, transfer, or burn audible books freely.

So when asked how to burn audible book to cd more than once, I will highly suggest you to remove the Audible DRM with [Epubor Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) first. Only by drm removing we can burn audible to CD more than once.

#### Step 1: Download Epubor Audible Converter.

![](http://www.epubor.com/images/faq.png) Frequently Asked Questions

##### Q: Why I can't listen to a CD I burned?

A: Check to make sure that your CD player plays CD-R discs. If you used a CD-RW disc, try burning the title again using a CD-R please. CD-RW discs will not always play on various CD players.
