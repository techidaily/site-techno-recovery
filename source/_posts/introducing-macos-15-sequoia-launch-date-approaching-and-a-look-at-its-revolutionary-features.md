## macOS 15 (Sequoia) Features

 This version of macOS includes updates to almost all of Apple's stock apps, along with a new, AI-focused interface. Here's a quick rundown of some of the new features:

**Calculator** : The biggest update to the Calculator app, possibly ever, shows your calculations and expressions as you enter them, keeps track of your history, and automatically converts units.

**Continuity** : We're used to[Handoff](https://www.lifewire.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handoff-4079966) , which lets us seamlessly keep working on apps between our iPhone and Mac, but macOS Sequoia kicks it up a bit by letting you completely run your iPhone from your Mac.

 Your iPhone will appear on your Mac's screen, and you can control everything, including apps and Facetime calls without picking up the device.

 Along with the mirroring, you'll also be able to drag apps between your iPhone and Mac and receive app notifications on your Mac.

Apple, Inc.

**Maps** : Maps in macOS Sequoia include topographic data and a library of hiking trails that includes all of the US' national parks.

**Messages** : Sequoia has a lot of the updates to Messages that also appear in[iOS 18](https://www.lifewire.com/ios-18-8552216) , like message scheduling and effects.

**Notes** : The Notes app in Sequoia gains live audio transcription, automatic calculation, collapsible headings, and color highlighting.

**Productivity** : MacOS Sequoia includes improved window tiling which even snaps windows into the corners. This upgrade is a welcome bonus to the usual side-by-side view.

 For calls, you can get a preview before you share your screen and also change your messy or boring background to either one of the preloaded options or one of your own photos.

**Safari** : Apple's web browser has an improved Reader that includes a table of contents and a summary, better video controls, and it will highlight relevant information on a webpage.
