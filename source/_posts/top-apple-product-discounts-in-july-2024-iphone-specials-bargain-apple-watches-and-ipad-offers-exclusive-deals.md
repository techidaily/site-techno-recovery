T-Mobile has a great deal for customers hoping to sign up for family plans.

The [carrier](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/devices/t-mobile-to-offer-all-new-iphone-15-lineup) will give customers up to four free [iPhone 15s](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/), applied in bill credits (up to $830 off per device), when they trade in older, eligible devices and sign up for an appropriate plan with four lines. 

While this is a great deal for a family plan, you can also enjoy the same $830 off -- ensuring that 128GB models are free -- for individual lines. Furthermore, T-Mobile allows customers to buy one and receive $700 off another when they add a line for iPhone 15s, iPhone 14s, or iPhone 13s. The discount is applied in monthly bill credits.

You can order an iPhone 15 directly from Apple, which is an excellent option if you don't want a carrier lock. 

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are thinner than their legacy counterparts. They come equipped with a USB-C port, 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, and the Dynamic Island camera design. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come with Apple's new A17 Pro CPU, a faster neural engine, and camera improvements, including a 5X telephoto lens on the Pro Max. 

You can receive up to $630 in credit when you trade in an older device and purchase through Apple. Apple Card cashback is also available. If your device doesn't meet trade-in standards, Apple will do the legwork to ensure you can recycle your device for free.

We can't expect many deals to appear for the recently announced 2024 Apple [iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/), powered by the firm's M4 chip. However, it's worth noting a trade-in promotion at Best Buy.

If you are willing to trade in an older device, you can save on the 11-inch and 13-inch models, which are $999 and $1,299, respectively. Starting prices with a qualifying, older device can be as low as $399.

## Can I buy an iPhone without a plan?

Yes, but you must ensure that your new iPhone is not locked to a specific carrier. You can buy unlocked iPhones, both new and pre-owned, from sources including Apple itself, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.

## What is the cheapest Apple product?

Apple's AirTag, a tracking device that connects to your account and allows you to find lost objects such as your keys, is Apple's cheapest product. Typically, a single AirTag retails for $29, whereas you can also purchase four-packs for around $99 outside of sales and promotions. 

## Is there a monthly fee for Apple iPads?

This depends on the type of iPad you decide to purchase. If you opt for a Wi-Fi-only iPad -- regardless of whether you have bought a classic iPad, iPad mini, or iPad Pro -- then there will be no monthly fee or subscription. 

However, if you choose an iPad with Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity, then you will need to pay for a mobile data plan to take advantage of the iPad's cellular features. 

## How did we choose these Apple deals?

While researching the best Apple deals, we scoured the web and checked out promotional prices offered by major US retailers, including Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and Walmart. 

We wanted to ensure we found the best deals on Apple products, including MacBooks, iPads, and iPhones, so we've shown you the latest discounts available -- but remember that stocks can be limited and sales pulled at any time. 

Factors influencing our recommendations include:

* **Price**: The main factor we consider is the price. If the discount isn't noteworthy relative to the original price point, we don't consider it worthy of inclusion.
* **Use cases**: We have included a range of Apple devices on sale suitable for different uses, including work, study, entertainment, and sports.
* **Variety**: Here at ZDNET, we want to provide you with various products and accessories in the Apple ecosystem. We've selected deals spanning laptops and smartphones to smartwatches and more.
* **Availability**: If we come across a great Apple deal but only a few units are in stock unless it is a stellar saving you only see once in a blue moon, we will discount it and select a product with better stock levels instead.
