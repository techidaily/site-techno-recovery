### 7 Things to Consider Before Buying a Smart TV

 Most TVs sold today are considered[smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) , sometimes called connected TVs. Smart TVs represent the convergence of computers and entertainment with integrated internet and an array of free and paid apps.

 We have all kinds of smart TVs across our staff, so we've developed this buying guide based on our personal experiences as well as industry standards to help you determine what kind of smart TV to buy based on your needs, budget, and preferences.

## What Is a Smart TV?

 A smart TV incorporates an operating system, allowing users to access[streaming content](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-streaming-how-it-works-1999513) without plugging in an external device. Smart TVs are popular with people who enjoy watching the latest shows on Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms.

 You can access, manage, and view online and network-based content with a smart TV. Almost all TVs sold today are considered smart TVs, and many manufacturers, including LG, Vizio, and Samsung, sell smart TVs.

## Top 7 Things to Consider When Buying a Smart TV

 Before deciding on a smart TV, there are seven key factors to consider when shopping:

* Cost
* Size
* Resolution
* HDR
* Refresh Rate
* Integrations
* Apps

## How Much Should a Smart TV Cost?

 No matter your budget, you should be able to find a smart TV you can afford. However, a higher budget will bring you additional features, bigger sizes, and higher resolutions. It may be worth it to invest in a higher-priced smart TV to future-proof your investment, but if you need something affordable right now, you'll still be able to find a quality device.

 Prices vary widely between manufacturers and models. Below are some general smart TV pricing guidelines, but you may find different sizes and higher resolutions for your price point if you shop around.  

| **Price Range** | **What You Can Expect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \>$300          | **Size** : 24 to 43 inches (If you find a larger one at this price point, it may lack quality.)**Resolution** : 1080p, HD resolution, or low-level upscaling.**Note** : Be on the lookout for discounted mid-range PCs at this price point.    |
| \>$600          | **Size** : 42 to 55 inches.**Resolution** : Up to 4K HDR.**Note** : While these sets may support 4K HDR, they may not offer the supporting technology, including panels, lighting systems, and processors, that can truly make the most of it. |
| \>$1,000        | **Size** : 42 to 65 inches (quality may vary).**Resolution** : Up to 4K HDR**Note** : At this price, you'll find good LCD TVs of various sizes with decent image quality. You may also find QLED models and lower-end OLED TVs.                |
| \>$2,000        | **Size** : 48 inches, 55 inches, and higher (quality may vary).**Resolution** : 4K HDR.**Note** : At this price, you'll see enhanced picture quality that really shows off HDR source material.                                                |
| \>$5,000        | **Size** : Up to 75 inches or higher.**Resolution** : Up to 8K.**Note** : At this price, you'll encounter floating glass displays, built-in audio arrays, and overall higher-quality materials.                                                |

## What Size Should My Smart TV Be?

 Size and resolution have a significant effect on a TV's price tag, so it's essential to carefully consider the size you want when buying a new smart TV.

 To determine the best smart TV size, measure the room's dimensions where you'll place the TV, and then decide which display size provides the viewing experience you want without overpowering the room.

 Smart TVs come in an array of sizes that vary by manufacturer. The most common sizes are 42 inches, 50 inches, 55 inches, 65 inches, and 75 inches (measured diagonally). Anything over 65 inches moves you into a much higher-priced category. There's also an extremely high-end market that caters to those who want[80-inch or 85-inch smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/best-80-to-85-inch-tvs-4682636) .

 Even if you've measured your TV room, you might find it difficult to picture exactly how your smart TV will fit. You're not alone. Some manufacturers have built augmented reality apps that allow customers to view how a TV will look in a room. Best Buy also offers an AR viewer so you can check how your new equipment will fit.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What Resolution Should a Smart TV Have?

 Most TVs come in three resolutions: 1080p, 4K, and 8K.

 We recommend getting a[4K resolution](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) TV for the best overall usage.[1080p resolution](https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837) TVs are fine, but they're outdated by today's standards, and you no longer pay any price penalty for getting the higher resolution.

[8K resolution](https://www.lifewire.com/8k-resolution-beyond-4k-1846844) TVs are now where 4K TVs used to be: High-end with a high price tag. It's probably not worth the investment just yet as the prices are high, and there's not a lot of content (TV shows or movies) in high enough resolutions to see any difference in picture quality.

 4K, also known as Ultra HD, is an excellent middle ground as it's a high-quality resolution with many affordable options available. Plus, many streaming services and apps offer 4K content, so you can take full advantage of what they offer.

## Should a Smart TV Have HDR Support?

 Most of the best smart TVs will come with a picture-improving technology called HDR (high dynamic range).

 HDR brings out a high level of detail in the darkest and lightest parts of a picture and improves the range of colors. You may encounter various HDR formats like HDR10, Dolby Vision, HDR 10+, and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma), but as long as the display has some HDR support, you're good to go. Differences between the formats are minimal.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What Refresh Rate Should a Smart TV Have?

 Smart TV displays offer 60Hz or 120Hz[refresh rates](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984) . This measurement refers to how many times the image resets per second. The more times it refreshes, the sharper the image stays, and the less motion blur you'll experience.

 A high refresh rate is excellent when watching sports, but be careful when watching movies at higher refresh rates. Films displayed that way can take on a look that doesn't mimic what you'd see in the movie theater.

 You'll likely keep the refresh rate set to 60Hz for most content, even on a higher-end TV.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What Integrations Should a Smart TV Support?

 One of the most compelling features of a smart TV is its ability to integrate with other smart devices in your home and utilize voice commands. For example, Android TVs from Sony have Google Chromecast and Google Assistant built-in. So, if you have a smart home with many Google devices, an Android TV would allow you to control your devices via the TV.

 If you have Amazon Alexa-enabled devices throughout your home, such as Echo Shows or Echo Dots, buying a smart TV that integrates Alexa makes sense.

 Consider your home, your other devices, and your preferences when deciding if you should buy a smart TV that integrates with a particular platform.

## What Apps Should a Smart TV Offer?

 A smart TV's primary purpose is to entertain, and your entertainment preferences will be a significant consideration when choosing a smart TV. Services like Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime are widely available across many platforms, but not all smart TVs will support all apps.

 All smart TVs will have some apps preinstalled, and most will have app stores where you can select and download additional apps. For example, Samsung smart TVs let you access Samsung Smart Hub, and LG TVs can access the LG Content Store. On the other hand, Vizio smart TVs have all their apps preinstalled. It adds new apps via updates, but you'd have to cast or screen mirror content from unsupported apps.

 Check any smart TV you're considering purchasing for its installed and available apps to ensure your favorites are onboard. Or, consider a[streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016) like a Roku stick to help supplement accessible apps.

## Who Should Buy a Smart TV?

 Anyone buying a TV these days should consider a smart TV. While standard TVs may be less expensive, smart TVs are more affordable than ever and give you more bang for your buck. You may even have trouble finding a 4K TV that doesn't have "smart" features.

 Better picture quality and expanded features, internet connectivity, apps, smart home integrations, and more make smart TVs a consideration for anyone looking for a new TV.

## More Tips for Buying a Smart TV

 There's no real "best" smart TV to buy because it's all about what you want and your personal preferences. Keep the following in mind:

* Make sure you know where you want to put the TV and that you have access to power, cable connections, and more.
* Beware of fireplaces and other heat sources that could damage your components.
* If you're wall-mounting your smart TV, consider going up a screen size since the TV will be flat against a wall and farther away from your seating area.
* Check if a TV supports your favorite streaming services before purchasing.
* Make a note of anything you might need to connect to the TV. Despite smart TVs being able to stream myriad content, they won't have a DVD or[Blu-ray](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-blu-ray-1846537) drive installed. Ensure the TV has enough HDMI ports if you want to attach anything to the TV (or get an[HDMI switcher](https://www.lifewire.com/best-hdmi-switchers-4134646) ).
* Pay attention to your smart TV's sound quality and determine if you need a soundbar or another speaker.
* If you're looking at smart TVs in a showroom, note how bright the screen appears in a brightly lit room.
* Monitor your potential smart TV for seasonal sales (such as Black Friday) and price fluctuations to get the best price.
