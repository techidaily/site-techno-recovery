## Windows 11 Installation Hurdles Cleared - Strategies That Worked for Us

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-10_15-19-07.png)

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error is one of the most reported errors that users get when they try to install Windows 10\. If you also encounter this exact error and have no clue what to do, you’ve come to the right place. In this post, we’ll walk you through the steps to fix the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

* [1: Remove the peripheral devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [2: Clear an attribute of $WINDOWS.~BT installation folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3: Uninstall the language pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [4: Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [5: Perform a clean boot installation](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [6: Repair corrupted system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Bonus tip: how to keep your PC at top condition](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1: Remove the peripheral devices

 The first quick fix you can try is to**unplug any unnecessary peripheral devices from your PC** and try to install Windows 10 again. For example, scanners, printers, a secondary monitor, speakers, etc. When any of these devices uses a generic driver, it may interfere with the installation and cause the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error.

 If the installation proceeds and turns out successful, you can plug the devices back in after your system gets updated. But if this doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Clear an attribute of $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error could be triggered when the installer tries to repeatedly copy the files in a certain folder. You can try to clear an attribute of the $WINDOWS.\~BT installation folder to see if it solves your problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**E** to open the File Explorer, and navigate to the**C drive** .
2. From the toolbar, click**View** and make sure you tick the checkbox of**Hidden items** .

3. You should find the**$WINDOWS.\~BT** folder here. Right-click it and click**Properties** .

 If this fix doesn’t solve the installation error you have, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Uninstall the language pack

 The “Windows 10 installation has failed” error may be triggered when the language pack of your previous Windows iteration is not the same as the localization. If that’s the case for you, you may need to remove the language pack. Here’s how:

#### On Windows 10

1. In the search bar on your taskbar, type**language** , then click**Language settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_15-03-06.png)
2. Make sure your Windows display language is set to**English** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_15-04-37.png)
3. Remove all the non-English language packs you have.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_15-05-07.png)

## Fix 4: Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data

 Any error found in Boot Manager could lead to the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error. The easiest way to fix the Boot Manager is to rebuild the Boot Configuration Data (BCD). It may seem a bit complicated, but the process is very straightforward. Here’s how:

 The ways to enter Command Prompt are different for Windows 7 and Windows 10/8\. You can follow the steps based on your Windows version to open Command Prompt first. The rest of the steps will work for all.

#### On Windows 10/8

1. Press the**Windows key** , search for**recovery** , then click**Recovery options** .

1. Restart your PC. When you see the manufacturer logo, keep pressing the**F8** key to enter the Advanced Boot Options screen.
2. Use the arrow keys to select**Safe Mode with Command Prompt** , then press**Enter** .

 Once you’ve opened the Command Prompt window, follow the steps below:

3. Run the installer again to test the issue.

## Fix 5: Perform a clean boot installation

 Sometimes the programs on your PC may interfere with Windows installation. If you’ve got a specific error code, it’s likely due to an incompatible software or driver. Removing the problematic software or[updating your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) may solve the problem.

 But when that doesn’t help or you don’t have an error code, then you may run a clean boot installation to identify the cause and fix the problem. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows ke** y, type**msconfig** in the search bar, and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_18-14-09-1.png)
2. Under the**General** tab, choose**Selective startup** , and make sure**the checkbox of Load startup items is unticked** .

## Fix 6: Repair corrupted system files

 If the fixes above didn’t solve the “Windows 10 installation has failed” error on your PC, you may be looking at a system-wide error. When the system files required for the Windows installation process are corrupted, it could trigger an installation error. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system corruption, but most of the time, manual repair is required.

## Bonus tip: how to keep your PC in top condition

 Outdated or faulty drivers may trigger this error, although not very common. And as we briefly mentioned before, if a driver issue caused this installation error, you’re likely to get a specific error code. But in general, keeping your device drivers up-to-date can help prevent and solve many random computer issues.

 There are two ways to keep your drivers up-to-date. One is to update the drivers via Device Manager. You may have to manually check every device and update them when Windows detects available updates.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
