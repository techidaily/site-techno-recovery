Juggling your tabs in Chrome can be a challenge -- especially if you're trying to find a specific tab amid all the open ones. Now, Google is kicking off three new ways to help you better organize multiple tabs.

In a [blog post published Tuesday](https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-update-september-2024/), Kayce Hawkins, Product Manager for Chrome, said the new features are designed to make it easier to access and organize your Chrome tabs on your phone, tablet, and computer.

First on the list are "tab groups." Already available on PCs and Android devices, "tab groups" are coming to Chrome for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823) and [iPadOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823?platform=ipad). Using your iPhone or iPad, you'll be able to group similar tabs and assign them a specific name as well as color-coordinate them to make each one easily identifiable.

To set up a tab group, open the tab grid, long press on the tab you want to organize, and then select the option for "Add Tab to New Group." After saving your tabs into groups, you can sort them and rearrange them in your ideal style.

Next up is the ability to sync your tab groups across multiple devices. Rolling out slowly for Chrome on mobile devices and computers, this feature will let you start a tab group on one device and then pick it up on a different one. Your "tab groups" are then automatically synced in Chrome across the board.

As one example suggested by Hawkins, you might start using Chrome on your phone to research restaurants and other activities for an upcoming trip. With all the information you collect, you create a tab group to organize it all. But you want a bigger screen to more easily view and work with your groups. That's when you turn to Chrome on your computer where the "tab groups" you created are synced and available.

That brings us to the third new feature, but this one is still in the experimental stage. However, in the coming weeks, Chrome will begin suggesting pages you may want to revisit based on the tabs you've already opened on other devices.

For example, maybe you're browsing a website while you're at work and want to access it when you're back home. Typically, you might have bookmarked the page or even written down the URL. But with this new trick, Chrome will proactively suggest that you revisit the site with a notice on the New Tab page on your iPhone, Android device, or computer.

"With these new tab features in Chrome, we're making it easier for you to keep track of tasks and conveniently revisit your favorite websites, all while switching between your devices at home or on the go," Hawkins said in the blog post.
