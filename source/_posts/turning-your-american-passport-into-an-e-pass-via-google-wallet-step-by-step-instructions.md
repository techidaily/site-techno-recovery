As part of a new beta test, Google Wallet will soon allow American users to create a digital ID of their US passport. This update is coming at a great time because we're only a few months away from the chaotic holiday travel season.

Google states that digital passports can save people "time and stress at the airport when… traveling domestically." [According to the announcement](https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/), digitizing your US passport is easy to do. 

You'll first have to select "Create an ID pass with your US passport" inside Google Wallet. Next, the app will instruct you to scan the security chip on the back of your passport. Finally, users will be asked to "take a selfie video" so their identity can be verified.

Google Wallet will then take the next several minutes to create your digital ID pass. Once it's finished, you'll receive a notification on your mobile device. This update will be available on all supporting Android phones, harnessing the system's "advanced security" features.

Digital ID cards are encrypted and stored on your smartphone. Users must authenticate themselves by using their fingerprint, PIN, or passcode whenever they want to view the pass. Sensitive information is not shared with anyone. You are in total control over everything. Also if you're in a situation where you don't have access to your phone, users can check out their passes over at the [Google Wallet website](https://wallet.google.com/wallet/home?utm%5Fsource=walletweb).

The tech giant recommends keeping your physical ID with you at all times. The technology is still in the early stages and should not be considered a replacement for the real thing. Plus, the Google Wallet passes only work at "select TSA checkpoints" in certain states.

Google links to a list on the [TSA website](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map) detailing all supporting locations. They include, but are limited to, the Los Angeles International Airport in California, LaGuardia Airport in New York, and Miami International Airport in Florida. 

The company says it is currently working with government agencies and regulators to expand digital ID support. For example, the tech could one day be used in car rentals and recovering accounts.
