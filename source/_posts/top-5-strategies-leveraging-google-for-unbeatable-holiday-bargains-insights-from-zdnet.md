Lucky for you, Amazon Prime's student membership can help you save. With [Amazon Prime Day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know/) coming up on July 16 and 17, now is the perfect time to switch from your existing Prime account, [sign up](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Fie%3DUTF8%26%2AVersion%2A%3D1%26%2Aentries%2A%3D0%26planOptimizationId%3DWLPStudentMonthlyEligiblePlans%26primeCampaignId%3DstudentWlpPrimeRedir%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for one in general, or test the six-month free trial. To help you make the switch, here's more information about Prime Student, its cost, and (many) perks. 

## What exactly is Prime Student? 

[Prime Student](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Fie%3DUTF8%26planOptimizationId%3DWLPStudentMonthlyEligiblePlans%26primeCampaignId%3DstudentWlpPrimeRedir%26ref%5F%3Dsm%5Fmkt%5Fpaper%26hvadid%3D410029237840%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D17688476521010283399%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3De%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D1022762%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-40174110923%26ref%3Dpd%5Fsl%5F7cy0nd6cg9%5Fe%26hydadcr%3D8893%5F11541712%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a discounted Amazon Prime service that gives higher education students and young adults the same benefits as a regular Prime member for half the cost. 

**Also: [The best early Amazon Prime Day 2024 deals](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-early-amazon-prime-day-2024-deals/)**

For example, the membership gets users access to Prime Video, Amazon Music Prime, Prime Gaming, Grubhub+, a 3-month Calm subscription, one month of Course Hero free, two months of Kindle Unlimited, savings on rental textbooks, and the usual Prime member perks such as exclusive deals access, including Amazon Prime Day sales, and free two-day, one-day, and even same-day shipping. 

## Who is eligible for a Prime Student membership? 

You're eligible if you meet one of these two criteria: You must be a student currently enrolled at a college or university or you must be between 18 and 24 years old. Whichever option you use -- student status or age -- Amazon will require you to verify your information with proof such as a .edu or school-linked email address or an ID, so make sure you have the credentials to back up your selection.

## How much does Prime Student cost?

Prime Student users start with a [free six-month trial](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Student%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D668781011%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) that you can cancel at any time. So, even if you aren't interested in a long-term membership, you could time your trial so that it overlaps with a massive sale like Prime Day and cancel before the membership fee kicks in.

After the trial period, the membership will cost [$69 per year](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Student%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D668781011%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) or $7.49 monthly, half what a regular Prime membership costs. If you subscribe now -- ahead of Prime Day -- you can go until December 2024 before paying anything for your discounted membership.

If you're a student with an existing Amazon Prime account but without the Prime Student perks, here's how to switch your existing Prime subscription to one more tailored to a student's lifestyle and price point. 

## How to switch to a Prime Student membership from an existing Prime account 

## 1\. Visit the Prime Student Page

Your first step is visiting the [Prime Student page](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3FprimeCampaignId%3DstudentWlpPrimeRedir%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1), where you will be presented with options to start your free six-month trial. You can then select the option that works best for you, either verifying your age or student status. Then, click on the big yellow button that reads, "Try Prime Student."

## 2\. Sign in to your existing Amazon Prime account

On the mobile app or web browser, log in to your existing Amazon account using the same email you registered with. You don't need to cancel this existing account to sign up. If you don't have an account, you can click on the "Create your Amazon account" button to go through the quick and simple process of creating an account.

## 4\. Fill out your credentials

Depending on the option you choose, after signing in, you'll be asked to submit proof of your credentials. For example, since I am not a college student but fall within the age limit, I chose the "Verify with Age" option. As a result, I was asked to verify my age with a photo of a valid ID such as a passport or driver's license. 

If you choose the "Verify with Student Status" option, you'll be asked to fill out a sign-up form and either use your .edu email address or submit proof of enrollment such as your student ID, your transcript, etc.

## How to join Prime Student if you don't have an existing Amazon or Prime account  

If you want to join Prime Student and don't have an account, you will need to sign up for an Amazon account, as seen in step 2 above. Then, you can follow all of the same steps. 

## FAQs  

## Do I get access to Prime Day sales with Prime Student? 

Yes. Since [Amazon's Prime Days is an exclusive sale](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-june-27/) for _all_ Prime members, Prime Students can benefit from the deals. And if you want to test the perks of Prime before fully committing, now might be a good time to take advantage of the six-month free trial. 

## How long does Prime Student last? 

Your membership lasts until you either stop being a student or turn 25, depending on the subscription tier you select. The free trial you get as soon as you enroll as a Prime Student expires after six months. 

## Do I have to cancel my current account to get Prime Student? 

No, you do not have to cancel or deactivate your account. Just [use this link](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3FprimeCampaignId%3DstudentWlpPrimeRedir%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3990756c-b593-4d0c-b6d4-b9d6808211c6%7Cdtp&dtb=1)to transfer your account. Your current benefits, however, may change. For example, if you currently have a 20% discount on home appliances, that may be revoked in place of the other perks.
