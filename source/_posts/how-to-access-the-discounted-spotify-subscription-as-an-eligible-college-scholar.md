 This article explains how to access the[ Spotify](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829) student discount, which provides students with a full[ premium account](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-spotify-premium-4580347) at half the price, with no restrictions. You'll also receive any current incentives or promotions.

##  How to Sign Up for the Spotify Student Discount

 Signing up for the Spotify student discount is almost as easy as signing up for a full-priced Spotify Premium account. The only difference is that you have to provide some information that Spotify will use to verify your enrollment at a qualifying institution.

1. Navigate to Spotify.com/us/student/, and click**GET STARTED** .  
![A screenshot of the Spotify Student landing page.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tJLno9OC-ySaw1RLxFSPPfTGhaQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1-255e6bb15e1148d9abb0293c57e135f3.JPG)
2. Log into your Spotify account, or click**SIGN UP FOR SPOTIFY** to create a new account.

3. Enter your information, and click**VERIFY** .  
![A screenshot of the Spotify student confirmation page.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mXFGl7eru9MJy9I52_h1MDlnUzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3-6a5242754bef4516816091c26691b80d.JPG)  
 You have to be currently enrolled at the school you select on this page. If you aren't, you won't be able to receive the student discount.
4. If SheerID (Spotify's verification system) is able to confirm that you are a student, you will automatically be verified. Enter your billing info to complete the signup process, and you'll be ready to start listening to your new Spotify account.

##  What to Do When Automatic Verification Fails

 If you see a message that Spotify and SheerID weren't able to verify your enrollment, that means you need to manually upload some supporting documentation. You can accomplish this by going through the signup process, and selecting the option to manually verify.

1. Navigate to Spotify.com/us/student/, and click**GET STARTED** .  
![A screenshot of the Spotify student landing page.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i4k-b-NFOH7gALP2kuj_ny0AUBU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1-79119ed54bec4fe7acfbfcda7e421e59.JPG)

##  Who Is Eligible for Spotify's Student Discount?

 The requirements for Spotify's student discount are very specific, so it's easy to tell if you qualify or not. If you are currently enrolled at a US Title IV accredited college or university, and you're at least 18 years old, then you qualify.

 Four-year universities, community colleges, and other accredited institutions all count, as long as they are US Title IV accredited. If you aren't sure if your school qualifies, you can use the Federal Student Aid site to check whether or not it is Title IV accredited.

 If you already signed up for a Spotify Premium subscription prior to enrolling at a qualifying school, you can still apply for the discount. If you're approved, you'll see the discounted price reflected the next time your subscription renews.

##  How Does Spotify Verify Student Enrollment?

 Spotify uses an identity verification service called SheerID to verify that you're actually enrolled where you say that you're enrolled. This is the same service that's used by Amazon, the New York Times, Nike, and a lot of other big names. So if you've signed up for an Amazon student discount already, you're ready to go for a Spotify student discount.

 When SheerID isn't able to automatically verify your enrollment, it allows you to upload supporting documentation. For this process to work, you'll need to scan your student ID, or make sure you have access to documents like your current class schedule, or an official enrollment letter if you haven't started school yet.

##  What Exactly Does the Spotify Student Discount Get You?

 The Spotify student discount provides you with a premium Spotify plan for about half as much as everyone else pays. That means you get full access to Spotify's full library of millions of songs, you can listen without any ad interruptions, and you can even choose to[ listen offline](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-caching-mode-in-music-services-2438241) .

 Depending on the current offers, the Spotify student discount may also provide you with extras, like a[ Hulu](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hulu-4783546) or Showtime subscription, for no additional charge.

##  What Happens to Your Student Discount When You Graduate?

 The Spotify Student discount is only available if you're actually enrolled at an accredited school. If you graduate, or leave school for any reason, you're no longer eligible for the discount.

 The way that Spotify enforces this policy is that they force you to re-verify your eligibility once every 12 months. When that time comes, you'll need to be able to provide a current student ID, current class schedule, registration receipt, or other supporting documentation.

 In the event that you aren't able to re-verify your enrollment at a qualifying institution, you will lose your access to the Spotify student discount. At that point, you will have the option to pay full price or[ cancel your Spotify subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-a-spotify-account-4781126) .
