If you've got some Kindle books, you've likely heard that they come with Amazon's Kindle DRM, which locks your books into Kindle devices ![remove drm from kindle books](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-drm-from-kindle-books.png)and kindle reading apps. But as a consumer, when we have already paid these files, why should we be stopped from reading them just because we didn't buy a Kindle but an iPad or a Kobo e-ink reader instead? This deeply hurts us. Right?

So if you want to read Kindle books on non-Kindle devices or apps, the perfect solution is to remove the DRM. And in fact, it is also the best way to protect your purchases and enables you to read your own books more freely. Additionally, it allows you to back up, copy, print, and share Kindle books with friends.

* [Method 2: Remove DRM from Kindle books with Python Scripts](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 3: Remove DRM from Kindle books with Shareware--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### First things first: Download Kindle books

To begin with, firstly I strongly recommend you get your kindle books prepared on your computer.

 If you have the Kindle e-ink device, you can just download Kindle books via your Kindle device. 

If you do not have Kindle device, you have to install Kindle App(kindle for pc/mac desktop application, or Kindle Cloud Reader web app). Launch the Kindle app, log in with your own amazon account, then all your purchased files in kindle store would be synced. Choose those files you want to deal with, double click on book cover, then downloading begins. Once you have done that, you can close the app, find your downloaded books files at destination folder ([kindle content folder location](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)). 

### Method 1: Remove DRM from Kindle books with Calibre Plugin

Calibre is an excellent ebook library management tool, open source software, helps you remove drm from books and convert format to others.

Step 1  Install Calibre.

Install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)(v7.x) onto your computer if you haven't already get them installed.

Then [download the latest DeDRM-tools](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM%5Ftools/releases/download/v10.0.9/DeDRM%5Ftools%5F10.0.9.zip)(v10.0.9). It comes as a .zip archive, and you need to unzip it, then open the unzipped folder and put the "DeDRM\_calibre\_plugin" folder where you can find it.

![open calibre dedrm plugin folder from dedrm plugin zip](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-plugin-zip-file.png)

Step 2  Install Calibre DeDRM Plugins.

Run Calibre on computer (here takes mac as an example, remove DRM from Kindle books with calibre mac).

From the pref pane "Preferences"--"Change calibre behavior".

![change calibre behavior on mac](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/change-calibre-behavior.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
(**Note:** Do _not_ click “Get plugins to enhance calibre”).

Click on Plugins (under “Advanced”) --"Load plugin from file".

![load plugin files on mac](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/load-plugin.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Select the "DeDRM\_plugin.zip" file you placed in step 1 and click "Open". 

![select calibre DeDRM plugin on mac](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/select-dedrm-plugin-zip-mac.jpg)

Click on the “Add” button, "Yes" in the "Are you sure?" warning dialogue that appears. 

![calibre DeDRM plugin added on mac](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/add-calibre-plugin-zip-on-mac.png)

After succeed the plug-in has been installed. Calibre will add this plugin under its "File type plugins" list in the Preferences window, OK. Restart Calibre please.

![DeDRM under file type plugins](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-location.png)

Step 3  Repeat the previous step to add the KFX-ZIP plugin to Calibre.

You should also have **[kfx input plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291290)** installed if trying to dedrm Kindle KFX books in 2024\. 

Step 4  Import DRMed books to Calibre.

If your kindle books are downloaded via Kindle desktop app, import your downloaded Kindle books to Calibre, then the DRM will be removed automatically. But if you've previously added books to calibre that with drm, you'd better import them again. Job done, you can click "click to open" at the right side, to get a preview in calibre library.

If your kindle books are downloaded via Kindle eReaders, you should customize the plugin and input the KSN info. 

![calibre kindle drm removal plugin](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/customize-dedrm-plugin.png)

**Update: (Due to a change in DRM) Calibre DeDRM plugins will no longer work with Kindle KFX books if Kindle for PC app updated to 2.4.1 (70946).** Re-install 2.4.70904, working as before, or you can also try to use the Epubor Ultimate as a better alternative.

### Method 2: Remove DRM from Kindle books with Python Scripts

**Notice: This method is a little hard to use, so if you are not so familiar with computer or code, I don't think challenging this method is a wise choice.**

Nearly all the eBook DRM Removal softwares are Python scripts, including Calibre.

Step 1  Install Python at first.

Firstly you need [Python](https://www.python.org/download/) installed on your computer.

Step 2  Install Pycrypto.

Pycrypto is a basic DRM module that all the DRM removal tools are using. Download and install it please.

For Win: [pycrypto-2.1.0.win32-py2.6.exe](https://www.epubor.com/freesource/pycrypto-2.1.0.win32-py2.6.exe)

For Mac: [pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz)

Step 3  Run KindleBooks.pyw.

Run [KindleBooks.pyw](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/KindleBooks.zip), then input the information related to Kindle Books: input file, output file, and Kindle.info. As your kindle ebooks has been downloaded to your computer via Kindle for PC/Mac, so it is easy to find the Kindle.info, because it will be created when the desktop application installed.

![run KindleBooks.pyw](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/KindleBookspyw.jpg)

### Method 3: Remove DRM from Kindle books with Shareware (DRM-off-Able)

This method is applied to both beginners and experts. And I highly recommend you get it with a free trial. I do believe after you tried it, you will fall in love with her.

Learn how to remove kindle drm 2024 with Video

Step 1  download the powerful shareware [Epubor Ultimate for PC or Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to your computer.

Download Epubor Ultimate for free:

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Step 2  Run Epubor Ultimate.

 Then the kindle books downloaded via Kindle for PC or Mac will be displayed under Kindle column in the left sidebar, while the Kindle books downloaded via Kindle devices will be displayed under Kindle Device column in the left sidebar after connecting Kindle e-ink reader to computer.

I highly recommend downloading Kindle books using [Kindle for PC 2.4.0](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForPC-installer-2.4.0-70904.exe) or [kindle for Mac 1.40](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg) to avoid issues with Kindle book drm removing failures.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 3  Rip Kindle DRM.

Add the Kindle books from the left sidebar to the right main window. Then all the books will be decrypted immediately.

![epubor decrypt kfx](https://epubor.com/images/uppic/epubor-decrypt-kfx.png)

It uses python scripts but much more easily to operate than method 2.

It provides more friendly interface than Calibre. Of course it's also easier than calibre to learn how to use.

1\. To active the drm-removing function on Calibre, you need to install extra drm plugin.

2\. Epubor Ultimate is definitely the most recommended tool for removing kindle drm because it is super easy-to-use and offers 7/24 customer support.

3\. DRM is intended to stop the illegal distribution of digital content, so please just keep the drm-free ebooks for yourself. Don't spread it. 

4\. For kindle manga to pdf conversion on Mac, there are two ways to handle them: [using kindle device](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) or [using Epubor kindle converter.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/kindle-converter/)

#### Review for Epubor Ultimate Software 

My theater group wants to stage a play. Unfortunately, the book we need does not exist in our country, Ecuador. The only place we find it is on Amazon, available to download for Kindle. Not all members of our theater group have a Kindle or a tablet to have the text available, so the most convenient thing is to print it. However, transferring a Kindle file to print is almost an impossible task. 

I tried to convert the book to pdf with the Caliber software, but it didn't recognize the book. I installed two plug-ins, one for Caliber to read KFX files and another to remove DRMs, but nothing. It was still useless. Also, I looked for converters online and they all failed. 

 Looking for more solutions, I came across [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) and it blew me away. I installed it, ran it and, immediately, it found the Kindle file, without me having to search for it, I hit convert and it converted it to PDF without any complications, without doing anything else, with one click, as if it were magic.

 Without a doubt, the best option for your Kindle files.

I have Kindle 1.23 on my mac, I've installed Calibre w/in the last 30 days and the latest deDrm plug-in from Alf (v. 6.6.1) and I can't convert a Kindle book purchased in January of 2019\. Could it be how I'm importing the actual book into Calibre? Right now all Kindle content is in my \~user/Library folder, which I only know how to access from the Finder app by choosing "Go" while pressing "Option" key. I don't know how to access \~user/Library from within Calibre. Adding the book to my library by dragging and dropping the .azw file is not working. Is there a reason a book purchased in Jan of 2019 can't be imported into Kindle 1.23 for Mac? Kindle says my last update was 9/2018 and I don't automatically update apps, so my Kindle version shouldn't have changed since then. I tried moving just the .azw file to my desktop and the errors were even worse. I also tried moving the whole folder to the desktop, and that did not work either. Please let me know if you have any suggestions!

 One note is you might want to mention to turn off auto update in the PC Kindle app. It might update itself to the newest version and "break" the plugin.

The Epubor works very well if you follow all steps. Only one point: the program only extract the DRM if you buy the license. It gives you a small demonstration but to have the hole kindle book available, you have to buy it.

Save your money if you have updated to the latest MacOS and just go with the Calibre option. The version of Kindle app they tell you to "downgrade" to is 32bit, thus will not work. Epubor was a much more efficient option until now. Maybe they'll come up with a "fix," but until they do, save your money.

If you have upgrade your Kindle app to 1.26 before updating your mac os to catalina and also, use this code: sudo chmod -x /Applications/Kindle.app/Contents/MacOS/renderer-test and then right click your kindle books for downloading. Then use Epubor Ultimate to remove Kindle drm successfully. Then when you update your mac os to catalina, you can still use this method to remove Kindle drm.

Thank you for using our software. For downloading kindle cloud reader, you just need to open the book and a downloading progress will show at the bottom right corner. Then just keep this book open until the download finished.   
 If you have no way to download kindle cloud reader books, then kcr converter will not convert them.

 For further assistance, please contact support@epubor.com

Hello, is there a way to remove DRM from amazon mobi books right from iPad? I don’t have a computer that I can use to use any of these services. I only use my iPad so I’m curious if there is a way to remove the DRM from a book I purchased on Amazon so that I can read the book on my Apple Books app. Thanks in advance!

Thank you. I decided to get a kindle version of a knitting pattern book instead of a hard copy for the portability and wanted to be able to print parts of it. Thank you for pointing out copying it from the kindle is better than using the download and transfer option, because the file formats weren't the same and callibre couldn't read the downloaded version to convert. My PDF is about twice as long as the hard copy of the book and probably won't be printing much of it, but I guess the formatting works better on mobile where I will use it most often anyway.

@joe said:

 This is strange, because if you open up that zipfile yourself, it does contain an \_\_init\_\_.py.

 This is the exact error message you would get if you had used the wrong zipfile. Are you sure you didn't use the DeDRM tools zipfile by mistake?

I have kindle for PC and was informed that I must updat to a new kindel for PC inorder to download and read a new book I had bought.  
 The version was 1.40.65535, from that point on I was unable to remove the new DRM. I am using epulor ulitimate. I went back to Kindle for PC 1.32 and again was told I could not download the book without upgrading to the new version. I did download the book to my Kindle 3g/wifi without any problem.  
 I found I could open my kindle documents file and locate the recently downloaded file. Epublor was able to decrypt AWZ3 file found in the documents and was able to convert to a Mobi.  
 This works just fine for me now, but would like to be able to do it from my kindle for PC.
