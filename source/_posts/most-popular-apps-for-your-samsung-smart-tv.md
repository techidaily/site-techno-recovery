 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content.

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.
