## Find Out - Which iPad Series Offers Built-In Global Positioning Services

 iPads with GPS can be used for navigation and other location-aware apps. However, you need the right model to take full advantage of its GPS features. Not all models have built-in GPS.

## Which iPad Models Have Built-In GPS?

 A built-in GPS chip is found in Apple's Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad models, which is an option for all available versions of the tablet. These devices cost more than the Wi-Fi-only versions.

 Apple never stated why it doesn't include a GPS chip in the Wi-Fi-only models. It might be because many apps that use GPS for navigation and other duties draw on data from the internet, even when you're out of range of a Wi-Fi signal. This means GPS apps are effectively broken when out of Wi-Fi range on a Wi-Fi-only iPad.

 You don't need to pay for a data plan for the GPS chip to work. If you get a Wi-Fi + Cellular model with no data plan, you won't receive fresh maps, points of interest, and other related data when out of Wi-Fi range.

## Wi-Fi-Only iPads Can Still Track Your Location

 Confusing the issue somewhat is that a Wi-Fi-only iPad can fairly accurately pinpoint your location under many conditions. As long as it can pick up a few Wi-Fi signals, it can use[Wi-Fi positioning](https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-positioning-system-1683343) , which draws on a database of known Wi-Fi hotspots, to determine where you are located.
