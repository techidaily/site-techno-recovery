## Top Rated FREE VPN Services - Comprehensive Review by Tech Experts | ZDNet

If you think you're getting something for free, remember that there's almost always a catch.

[Virtual Private Network (VPN) services](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) are no exception. The majority of free VPNs are supported by either premium subscribers or the sale of your data, which nullifies the point of a privacy-enhancing service in the first place. 

There are still free options offered by reputable companies that preserve your privacy. However, keep in mind that free VPN plans will come with limitations, such as server availability, low speeds, or no access to advanced features. They will also not be suitable for bandwidth-heavy applications, so if you're hoping to stream or torrent, you might encounter problems.

## What is the best free VPN right now?

The company, developed by the team behind the encrypted ProtonMail service, offers a free VPN supported by paying subscribers. It's limited in terms of devices and services but is still a top-tier VPN that will help you securely maintain your privacy.

### ProtonVPN

#### Best free VPN overall

ProtonVPN offers the most comprehensive and useful free VPN service, mainly because there are no data caps and, most importantly, your data is secure. 

ProtonVPN allows you to connect to servers in five countries -- the Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Poland, and the US -- a recent upgrade from a previous limit of the US, the Netherlands, and Japan. During our tests, we found speeds to be consistent, but they are rated as "medium" compared to the full 10Gbps speeds the VPN is capable of.

What we like most about ProtonVPN is that it comes from the same team that created Proton Mail, a security-first email service. Rather than bombard you with adverts or demand your data, the free option is supported by paying subscribers. You should note, however, that you will not have torrent or streaming support with the free plan.

For anyone who wants to try out ProtonVPN's paid service, it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. The cheapest paid plan is the two-year deal, which costs $4.49/month and comes with 10 simultaneous connections and locations in over 90 countries, alongside numerous advanced features.

Customers say they love the free option but note that the main catch is server availability. 

**Proton free VPN specifications:** **Simultaneous Connections:** 1 | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chromebook | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** Same as with a paid subscription | **Data limit**: None | **Speed limit:** Yes | **Countries**: 5

Pros 
* Custom plans
* Extensive server network
* Browser extension available
* Wireguard

Cons 
* Traffic limit

### Windscribe

#### Best free VPN for server network

Windscribe's free plan is an excellent option in terms of speed and servers. The same network -- 69 countries and 134 cities -- is available for free and paid plans, and the VPN is suitable for streaming, as a bonus.

What sets this free VPN apart is that there is no limit to simultaneous connections. You can use the free option on as many devices as you like -- but keep in mind that due to its 2GB/month limit, you might reduce its monthly lifespan. If you enter your email address at the time of sign-up, however, you can bump this up to 10GB/month. 

Users like the speed and streaming capabilities of the free Windscribe VPN, but many dislike the interface. If you would prefer advanced features and to remove the data cap, plans begin at $5.75/month -- or you can create your own custom plan.

**Windscribe free VPN specifications: Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, FireTV | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** Online form, online FAQ only | **Data limit**: 2GB/10GB monthly | **Countries**: 69 | Browser extension available

Pros

* Fast

Cons

* No 24/7 support

### Hotspot Shield VPN

#### Best free VPN for speed

Hotspot Shield VPN is lightning fast, and during our testing, we found it often held its own with the top paid VPNs. 

Despite its excellent speed, the free version of the Hotspot Shield VPN will have limited use for just about any user because of its daily data cap of 500MB, which in the world of browsing bandwidth-heavy websites and streams, will not get you very far. Another downside is that the free version is limited to locations in the United States. It is ad-supported, which is far from ideal, but this free VPN could be useful if you just need an option for quick and casual online tasks. 

You can unlock all of Hotspot Shield VPN's features, including access to 3,200 servers in over 70 countries, for $7.99/month with an annual plan. The paid service has a 45-day money-back guarantee. Customers say this is a good VPN option for accessing geoblocking content but other VPN vendors offer better value for money. 

**Hotspot Shield free VPN specifications:** **Simultaneous Connections:** 1 | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** None, online FAQ only | **Data limit**: 500 MB daily | **Countries**: 1

Pros

### Hide.me

#### Best free VPN for beginners

Hide.me is a reasonable option for a free VPN. While it is limited regarding server choice and streaming unless you upgrade, it does offer a simple user interface that is good for beginners. Also, the free option provides users with 10GB of data per month. 

Users say they like how easy the free version of this VPN is to use and like the speeds on offer, but some say they are put off by the restrictions to country selection and streaming. Paid plans begin at $2.69/month. 

**Hide.me free VPN specifications: Simultaneous Connections:** 1 | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, FireTV, Linux | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** 24/7 | **Data limit**: 8GB/month | **Locations**: 5

Pros 
* Unlimited connections

Cons

### TunnelBear

#### Best free VPN for streaming

If you're looking for a free VPN that can be used to access a variety of streaming services, TunnelBear is worth exploring. 

TunnelBear has locations in 47 countries, the majority of which are dotted around the United States and Europe. During testing, we found that many streaming services were accessible without noticeable changes in speed. There is a 2GB/month data limit to keep in mind, but you can download and use this VPN on as many devices as you like. 

Paid plans begin at $3.33/month. 

**TunnelBear free VPN specifications: Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android | **Logging:** None | **Customer service:** Online form, online FAQ | **Data limit**: 2GB/month | **Countries**: 47

## What's the best free VPN?

For most people, a free VPN service isn't going to meet your needs, even if it's a provider with a strong reputation. However, ProtonVPN's free service is above most of the free VPNs offered by other providers. The data limits and restrictions of the typical free VPN render them essentially useless. But ProtonVPN doesn't put these same caps on its free service.

You may not be able to unblock streaming services with the free version of ProtonVPN, but it's still a great everyday VPN. Below, we have outlined the major differences between our top free VPNs.

| | Countries        | Data limit  | Logs       |      |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ProtonVPN          | 5           | None       | None |
| Windscribe VPN     | 69          | 2GB/month  | None |
| Hotspot Shield VPN | 1           | 500MB/day  | None |
| Hide.me            | 5 locations | 10GB/month | None |
| TunnelBear         | 47          | 2GB/month  | None |

## Which is the right free VPN service for you?

There are only a handful of reasonable free VPN plans on the market, and depending on your needs, you might want to explore different options. Below are our best use cases for each recommendation we have made.

## Factors to consider when choosing a free VPN

If you're set on a free VPN instead of a paid service, there are a number of factors you should consider:

* **The finer details**: Nothing in life is free -- and this includes VPN services. You should check the fine print when it comes to using a VPN, as you may be required to hand over your data or view adverts, for example, in return.
* **Connections**: If you need to connect multiple devices to your VPN service, a free VPN is unlikely to be suitable. Most are extremely limited, so your expectations need to be tempered with free VPN practices.
* **Use**: You also need to consider what you want to use a VPN for. A free VPN might be fine for casual browsing, for example, but is unlikely to work well for streaming or gaming.
* **Speed**: Some free VPNs will have bandwidth and speed caps.
* **Company reputation**: Always choose a reputable VPN provider. Free VPNs offered by unknown or shady companies could place your privacy and data at risk.

## How did we choose these free VPNs?

In order for a free VPN to land on our best free VPNs list, it had to be a service provided by a reputable company that we trust. All of the VPNs on our list follow this model, which means you'll be getting access to a service that follows the same privacy policy and provides the same level of encryption as some of the [best VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) we've tested.

Security shouldn't be an issue, but performance probably will be. These free VPNs are all a lead-in for upgrade sales in one way or another. They offer a small amount of free access and when you eat up that bandwidth, they'll ask you to upgrade. 

## How we test VPNs

Most VPN providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been writing about these VPNs for years, spoken with their management and users, and developed a generally favorable impression. Here are the top factors we consider during our testing process: 

* **Performance:** We tested most of the VPNs on this list to ensure robust performance in terms of connection and speed. After all, there's no point in using a VPN if your connection continually drops or lags, making it intolerable, which is especially important when you're on mobile.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, and laptop you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows simultaneous connections. However, free options are typically limited to one device.
* **Security:** There's no point using a VPN unless their security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured that the development team behind each recommended VPN cares about improving security over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection and is an essential feature for a mobile VPN to have, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection -- in comparison, for example, with your cellular connectivity -- should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.

## What exactly is a VPN?

VPN is an acronym for Virtual Private Network, a term used for services that allow you to encrypt your internet traffic between your computer and a destination computer on the VPN service. This is particularly necessary when using a public connection, like a hotel or coffee shop's open Wi-Fi, so that other guests can't watch all your traffic and steal juicy bits, like credit card numbers and passwords.

## Which free VPN is best for streaming?

In short, there isn't one. Free VPNs typically don't support streaming or have such restrictive data limits that even if they did, it wouldn't be practical. That's on top of the potential risks inherent with free VPNs. Even with a paid VPN service, it can take some effort to find the right service or server location that will unblock the streamer you want to access. 

If the main reason you want a VPN is for streaming, then we recommend taking advantage of a money-back guarantee period to test out one of the [best VPNs for streaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-streaming-fire-stick-netflix-more/). The only way to be 100% certain that a particular VPN service is going to work for you is to try it out for yourself.

This is also a gray area of the law, despite many VPNs marketing themselves as great options for streaming and accessing geolocked libraries.

## What are the risks of free VPN services?

There are many free VPN services, but you probably shouldn't trust most of them.

Here's the thing: Running a VPN service is expensive. You need either servers and data lines, or you're paying a cloud vendor like Amazon for every bit received, sent, and stored. Either way, it costs money. So, think about this: If you're running a free VPN service, how do you pay for all that expense?

You. In the back of the room. I see your hand up. "Ads," you say. Yep, that's a possibility. Some free VPN services plaster ads on your browser display and sell those to whoever will pay.

You could also be putting your data at risk, too. A free VPN service could make money selling data. And someone with more nefarious intentions could pick up a lot of credentials quickly, by setting up a free VPN and waiting for people to just hand over personal information. 

## How can I tell if my VPN is working or not?

A fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working properly, there are tools that make checking your VPN's performance easy.

You can find out your IP address and location using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). Just compare the IP address and location when you're connected with a VPN vs. without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.

It's also possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. To ensure your VPN doesn't have any issues with DNS leaks or IP leaks, you can run tests on a site like [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/). There are plenty of tools that allow you to test for leaks, but many are owned by VPN providers and it may not always be clear who developed the tool, which could be a conflict of interest. You may want to run tests with several different sites and compare the results.

## What are simultaneous connections and why should you care?

It's the maximum number of VPN connections you can have at any one time. For example, if you're using your smartphone, laptop, and tablet over a VPN at the same time, and back home, your partner is using their smartphone and PC over the VPN, and you have five simultaneous connections.

The more connections, the better. However, most free VPNs will be very limited in how many simultaneous connections you can have -- and you may only be able to connect one device. Indeed, even some paid plans have device connection limits. 

## Are there alternatives to these free VPNs worth considering?

In a best-case scenario, free VPNs will have extremely limited functionality. But there are affordable alternatives with the security and performance to meet most user demands. If you're willing to try out a paid subscription, check out the recommendations below:
