## Expanded Compatibility: Bing Chat Now Functional Across Chrome & Firefox

### Key Takeaways

* Bing Chat is now available on non-Microsoft browsers, but there are limitations compared to using it on Microsoft Edge, such as fewer turns per session and a lower character count.
* Microsoft has a history of trying to push users towards its own browser, so the original limit for non-Edge browsers in Bing wasn't shocking.

 If you want something to help you scour the internet and give you AI-generated answers, [Bing Chat](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-insiders-look-at-securing-fb-status-videos/) is the best option right now. The chatbot has sought to position itself against [ChatGPT](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capture-clarity-editing-insights-for-professional-results/) and [Google Bard](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhance-branding-the-ultimate-guide-to-custom-urls-for-youtube/), but there was one small problem with it — at least on desktop PCs, Google really wanted to make it exclusive to its own browser, Edge. Now, it's rolling it out to other browsers, but it will have some limits if you're unwilling to use Edge.

 Microsoft has a history of trying to get people to use its browser by any means possible, whether it's politely asking to not-so-politely asking and even [actively attempting to make it harder to switch](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-notes-an-introduction-to-youtube-list-making/) default browsers. It's company policy to do this kind of stuff in an invasive manner, so it's definitely not surprising to see the company also be stingy about using Bing Chat on a non-Microsoft browser. The company can't ignore those exist forever, so it has decided to finally let third-party browser users check out Bing Chat too.

 All you need to do is to [open Bing](https://www.bing.com/), and you'll be prompted to check out Bing Chat. Log in with your Microsoft account, and start asking Bing questions. There are a few limitations you need to be aware of, though. Namely, Bing Chat only gives you 5 turns per session while using it on a third-party browser, while on Edge, those turns are increased to 30\. Also, Bing in other browsers limits character count to 2,000 characters, while on Edge, you get 4,000 characters. And if you think having a restricted experience will stop Microsoft from trying to get you to use Edge, you'd be wrong — Microsoft will still give you pop-up prompts to download Edge.

 Microsoft clearly still wants to get people to use Edge, but it also can't ignore the existence of other browsers. So if it really wants to succeed, it can't block people from using it, so it looks like Microsoft insisting on giving people a restricted experience is as good as you'll get it unless you want to switch to Edge.
