## Comparing iPad Pro Mini (M4) with MacBook Air (M3): Key Differences Explored

 Comparing the MacBook Air M3 and iPad Pro M4 starts with the processors the devices are built around, but it doesn't stop there. With factors like screen size, weight, cameras, and more, the computers differ in many ways (and have some similarities, too). This article compares them to help you understand which one might be best for you.

![iPad Pro M4 vs. MacBook Air M3](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nZJZzpT8fXIfTo9JM4UuRluFcpE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iPad-Pro-M4-vs-MacBook-Air-M3-2b5735b605954b7ca86c8a8c01c8286f.jpg)

## Overall Findings

 iPad Pro M4

* Apple M4 chip: 9- or 10-core CPU.
* 10-core GPU; 16-core Neural Engine.
* Up to 20% faster than MacBook.
* 11- or 13-inch screen.
* 8 or 16 GB RAM; 256GB-2TB hard drive.
* Up to 10-hour battery.
* Two cameras.
* 0.98-1.28 pounds.

 MacBook Air M3

* Apple M3 chip: 8-core CPU.
* 10-core GPU; 16-core Neural Engine.
* 13- or 15-inch screen.
* 8, 16, or 24 GB RAM; 256GB-2TB hard drive.
* Up to 18-hour battery.
* One camera.
* 2.7-3.3 pounds.

 The differences between the iPad Pro M4 and MacBook Air M3 go beyond their hardware (though the rest of this article will be focused on technical differences). They're also about how the devices are used.

 The MacBook is a traditional laptop, while the iPad is a tablet. No one would think twice if the MacBook were your only computing device: It has a keyboard and mouse, a great screen, support for all kinds of peripherals, and can run the huge library of Mac software.

 The iPad could be your only device, but that requires a little more work. For one thing, an iPad keyboard is a separate purchase. Beyond that, there are fewer supported peripherals (though still a lot), the iPad software library is a bit less varied, and iPadOS lacks some power-user features.

## Processor Speed: iPad Is About 20 Percent Faster

 iPad Pro M4

* Uses the M4 chip.
* 9- or 10-core CPU.
* 120 GB/s memory bandwidth.

 MacBook Air M3

* Uses the M3 chip.
* 8-core CPU.
* 100 GB/s memory bandwidth.

 These two devices have different processors at their heart. The iPad Pro uses Apple's cutting-edge[M4 chip](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-m4-chip-8640914) , which debuted in 2024, while the MacBook Air uses 2023's M3\. Both are great, but the M4 has Apple's latest technology and advancements.

 The M4's CPU (Central Processing Unit) has 9 or 10 cores, depending on the model. The M4 can also handle more data faster, thanks to its 120 GB/s memory bandwidth. The M3 is no slouchâ€”it's very fast and consumes power efficientlyâ€”but the additional cores and higher memory bandwidth mean that in tests, the M4 is about 20 percent faster than the M3.

 It's important to remember that the benchmark tests used to get that number aren't the same as real-world use, so that difference won't always be consistent.

## Processor Power for Graphics and AI: iPad Is a Bit Faster

 iPad Pro M4

* 10-core GPU.
* 16-core Neural Engine.
* Media Engine.

 MacBook Air M3

* 10-core GPU.
* 16-core Neural Engine.
* Media Engine.

 A key question these days is how a processor does with the[artificial intelligence](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-artificial-intelligence-5119206) tasks that companies are adding to all of their devices. Apple is no exception; both[macOS Sequoia](https://www.lifewire.com/macos-15-8557761) and[iPadOS 18](https://www.lifewire.com/ipados-18-8558715) will include some AI functionality. With these features, the M4 is still faster, but only slightly.

 The basic architecture of the two chips in this area is the same. Both have 10-core[GPUs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-gpu-5226033) (for graphics performance and[generative AI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-generative-ai-7510795) ), 16-core Neural Engines (AI and[machine learning](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-machine-learning-7495518) ), and identical Media Engines for A/Vâ€”but the newer M4 edges out the M3\. Remember, raw processing power isn't all that matters here. So do RAM and the apps being used.

## Screen: MacBook's Is Bigger, iPad's Does More

 iPad Pro M4

* Screen sizes: 11- and 13-inch.
* Touchscreen.
* Apple Pencil support.
* OLED Retina Display with ProMotion and TrueTone color.

 MacBook Air M3

* Screen sizes: 13.6- and 15.3-inch.
* LED Retina Display with TrueTone color.

 Both the iPad and MacBook have terrific screensâ€”roomy and bright with brilliant colorâ€”but the iPad Pro offers more features. First off, it's a touchscreen and supports the[latest Apple Pencil](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-pencil-3-8584088) . It also uses Apple's[ProMotion](https://www.lifewire.com/why-promotion-on-the-iphone-13-is-a-big-deal-5201956) display technology for extra-smooth scrolling and[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091) technology to reduce battery drain. Still, the MacBook's screen looks great and is larger than the iPad's.

## Battery: MacBook Beats iPad By a Full Work Day

 iPad Pro M4

* Up to 10-hour battery.

 MacBook Air M3

* Up to 18-hour battery.

 For battery life, the MacBook Air M3 and iPad Pro M4 comparison has a clear winner. The MacBook Air's larger battery lasts almost twice as long as the iPad's for the same tasks (Apple bases its projections on audio and video streaming).

 Remember, though, that battery life is based on how you use the device, and doing things that are more power-intensive than just streaming (games, AI, video editing, etc.) will be more taxing regardless of which device you use.

## Camera: iPad's Two Cameras Are Better

 iPad Pro M4

* One user-facing camera, one back-facing camera.
* Photos and videos at 4K resolution.
* Flash, zoom, low-light features.

 MacBook Air M3

* One user-facing camera.
* Photos and videos at 1080p resolution.
* No flash, no zoom, no low-light features.

 If you want a device to take photos or videos, the iPad Pro M4 is the clear choice. The iPad has two cameras: a user-facing camera for selfies and[FaceTime](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facetime-2000237) and a rear camera with an ultra-wide lens, both of which capture 12-megapixel images. It can record video in up to 4K resolution and has great photography features like[Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting](https://www.lifewire.com/portrait-mode-and-portrait-lighting-on-iphone-4156748) and low-light optimizations.

 The MacBook only has a 1080p user-facing camera. That's plenty good for video calls, but for photos and video capture, you'll want something more flexible.

## Options and Peripherals: MacBook Is More Versatile

 iPad Pro M4

* One Thunderbolt/USB 4 port and headphone jack; physical volume buttons.
* Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, optional 5G cellular.
* Two colors.
* Four speakers, surround sound, Spatial Audio (with AirPods).
* Face ID authentication.

 MacBook Air M3

* Two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports and headphone jack.
* Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
* Four colors.
* Six speakers, Spatial Audio (with AirPods).
* Touch ID authentication.

 Both the iPad Pro M4 and MacBook Air M3 have tons of other featuresâ€”and we can't cover them all hereâ€”but here are some of the most noteworthy ones:

 The MacBook is better able to be the center of your computing life thanks to its to USB ports, which let it support more accessories like USB hubs, monitors, printers, and more. The iPad only has one USB port.

 The MacBook's audio system also packs more speakers, though it lacks the Surround Sound offered by the iPad.

 One area where the iPad outpaces the MacBook is networking. While both devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, only the iPad offers 5G cellular networking to get online anywhere there's a signal (it's an add-on cost to both the iPad and your phone company's data plan).

## Final Verdict: Both Are Great, but Your Needs Will Vary

 There's no perfect choice for everyone when pitting the MacBook Air M3 against the iPad Pro M4\. As we've seen, both devices have a lot of similarities. Of course, they share the Apple ecosystem and use features like iCloud, Apple Pay, iMessage, and so on. Even in the areas that they're different, each one has clear advantages over the other in some cases.
