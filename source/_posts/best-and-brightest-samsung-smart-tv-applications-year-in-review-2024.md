 What We Like

* Sync your game across multiple devices.
* It tracks your move history.
* No time limits per move.

 What We Don't Like

* The bare-bones graphical interface.
* Not free.

 Although_Game Pigeon_ features a version of Chess,_Checkmate!_ offers a superior experience. For $0.99, you can chat as you play and play multiple games at once. There's no timer between turns, so you can take as long as you need to consider your next move.

 What We Like

* An interesting concept with lots of possibilities.
* A great tool for settling disputes.

 What We Don't Like

* Turn-based play doesn't match excitement of real air hockey.
* Some of the built-in bets are a bit crude.

_Let’s Puck It!_ puts an interesting spin on an old American pastime by encouraging players to wager bets. You can choose from a list of options like “loser buys dinner,” or you can make up your own stakes. Be careful what you wager because the pace of the puck increases with every volley.
