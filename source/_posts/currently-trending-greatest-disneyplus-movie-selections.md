**IMDb Rating** : 7.1/10

**Genre** : Comedy, Action, Adventure

**Starring** : Harriet Sansom Harris, Kirk R. Thatcher, Eugenie Bondurant

**Director** : Michael Giacchino

**Rating** : TV-14

**Running Time** : 52 minutes

 Based on one of Marvel's less-celebrated heroes,_Werewolf by Night_ is about a lycanthrope who uses his preternatural powers for good rather than evil. When the legendary Bloodstone comes up for grabs, Jack Russell (Gael García Bernal) must make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

_Werewolf by Night_ is an obvious tribute to old Universal monster films like_The Wolf Man_ ,_The Mummy,_ and_Frankenstein_ , but it's still a Marvel movie with all the requisite action and humor. You can even choose between classic black-and-white or scratchy color versions.
