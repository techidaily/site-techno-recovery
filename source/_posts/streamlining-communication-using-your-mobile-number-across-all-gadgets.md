 You'll find many videos on sign language here, and the lessons are in order of difficulty, so you can progressively learn to sign like you would with any other language.

 There are 12 free sign language units, and several additional free videos, available from Dr. Byron W Bridges. You’ll start off learning basic vocabulary, like greetings, food, and school-related signs. The final lessons teach you emotions and full conversations.

 After completing these videos, you should have a better grasp on the basics of sign language.

## Printable Sign Language Charts

![Sign language letters and numbers](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3F4ZkvdgO6Xxhrfp-TxQ4GlUcHs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sign-language-numbers-letters-lifeprint-7e6dac833d4e44deb202b7b269cdd7e6.png)

 Printable sign language charts are good for instant reference. Put a few in your pocket, place them around the house, or spend some time memorizing them to learn offline.

* [Start ASL's free sign language chart](https://www.startasl.com/free-sign-language-chart/) : This resource provides images of comon words like "what," "how," "hungry," "bathroom," "woman," and "food" being signed. Instructions for how to sign are below most of them.
* [Lifeprint's alphabet fingerspelling](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/wallpaper1.htm) : Print these two sets of pictures to learn the alphabet. Both sets have the letters on the hands, but they also have a version without the letters for practice.
* [These numbers/common words/letters](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/learning-languages/american-sign-language/signing-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-208315/) : This cheatsheet is similar to the other printables here with four images you can print for keywords, such as "how," "which," "where," "yes," "please," "thanks," "goodbye," etc. There are also printables for the alphabet and numbers one through 10.
* [Print individual letters in sign language](https://www.teachersprintables.net/category/sign%5Flanguage) : These printables includes large letters of the alphabet represented in sign language. One way to use these is to print them off and place them next to objects that start with that letter for passive learning.
