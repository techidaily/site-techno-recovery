## Stop Automatic Updates on Your Windows 11 PC with These Easy Tricks

Windows Update is a feature that automatically checks and provide updates for our computer.

 But sometimes it can be such a big pain that you want to turn it off.

 Here are 3 easy-to-follow methods you can try to**stop Windows update in Windows 10** .

## Try these methods

 You may not have to try all the methods (methods 1-3) to**disable Windows Update on your Windows 10** ; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable the Windows Update Service](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Meter your Wifi network](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Change Group Policy Settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Bonus tip: Update your device drivers via Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Disable the Windows Update Service

 Method 2 is pretty much self-explanatory. By**disabling the Windows Update Service** , Windows will stop checking for updates, hence sparing you the wanted Windows updates. To do so:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**   into the box and click **OK** .

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

### Method 2: **Meter your Wifi network**

 If you’re using Wifi network, then method 2 will just do the trick. By**metering your Wi-fi network** , Windows will automatically take it that you’re on a limited data plan (even if you aren’t) and stop forcing Windows updates on your computer. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** , type**wifi** and click**Change Wi-Fi settings** .

 It’s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.
