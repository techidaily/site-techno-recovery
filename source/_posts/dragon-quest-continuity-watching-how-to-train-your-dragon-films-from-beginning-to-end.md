###  What to Know

* Chronological/release: How to Train Your Dragon (Freevee), HTTYD 2 (Netflix), HTTYD: The Hidden World (DirecTV).
* Most of the shorts and TV series take place between the first two movies.
* The supplemental shows and shorts are not all available on the same streaming platforms.

 This article explains where to stream all of the “How to Train Your Dragon” films, and what order to watch them.

##  How to Watch Every How to Train Your Dragon Film in Release/Chronological Order

 The story that’s covered in all three “How to Train Your Dragon” films progresses chronologically—no prequels or side stories. This means the release order is exactly the same as the chronological order. Either way, you’ll be following along with Hiccup and Toothless’ adventures in the same order.  

 There’s no one place to stream all three movies together with a subscription, but you can rent and watch through the entire trilogy via services like Amazon Prime or AppleTV.

| **Movie**                                    | **Release Date** | **Where to Stream**             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| _How to Train Your Dragon_                   | March 2010       | Amazon Prime Video              |
| _How to Train Your Dragon 2_                 | June 2014        | Netflix Amazon Freevee          |
| _How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World_ | February 2019    | DirecTV Fubo Amazon Prime Video |

##  How All the How to Train Your Dragon Shorts and Shows Fit In

 While there are only three main movies in the “How to Train Your Dragon” series, and they were all released in chronological order, there are also a lot of TV shows and shorts available. Almost everything takes place between the first and second movies, but here’s their specific order:  

 Unfortunately, there’s no one single service that offers all of the supplemental short films and TV series together—you’ll need to jump between streaming platforms.

| **Movie/Series**                             | **Release Date**               | **Where to Watch**              |
