##  How to Get Copilot for Microsoft Teams

###  A Microsoft Business or Enterprise Subscription 

 To use Copilot for Microsoft Teams, you’ll need two separate subscriptions. First, you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, or Premium account. Unfortunately, it’s not enough to have a Microsoft 365 Personal account.

 The good news is that you can get a free trial for Microsoft 365 Business Standard if you only want to try Copilot for Teams. After that, pricing for each three subscriptions is as follows: 

| **Microsoft 365 Business Basic** | **Microsoft 365 Business Standard** | **Microsoft 365 Business Premium** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $6 per user, per month           | $12.50 per user, per month          | $22 per user, per month            |

 You can also use Copilot for Teams with some Microsoft Enterprise accounts, but your subscription must also include Teams. So, if you haven't already, you'll have to upgrade.

###  A Microsoft Copilot Subscription 

 After signing up for a Microsoft 365 Business account, you’ll also need to get Copilot as an add-on. Your IT admin (or you, if you are that person) should see a message that says: 

 “Copilot for Microsoft 365 is available to order now”. 

![A screenshot saying that Copilot is available for Teams i your subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2D727oZ39tGGmRBUsHg2VwKc-ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/CopilotforMicrosoftTeamsAvailable-614ff945b07246c192fa1c9b7266d2a9.jpeg) 

 Once you’ve entered your personal information and payment details, you should then be able to use Copilot in Teams. If you don’t see this message, you can[ buy Copilot on the Microsoft website](https://microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365) . 

 Copilot costs $360 per year. If you aren’t already familiar with the software and want to learn more about it before purchasing, check out our guide on[ what Microsoft Copilot is](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-microsoft-copilot-8572496) .

For example, if you[ use Copilot in Word](https://www.lifewire.com/use-copilot-in-word-8629526) , you can create drafts. It’s also possible to[ use Copilot in Excel](https://www.lifewire.com/use-copilot-in-excel-8635295) to interact with different data points. For both, you’ll need a Copilot subscription.
