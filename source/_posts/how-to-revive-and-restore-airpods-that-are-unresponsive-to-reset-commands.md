## How to Revive and Restore AirPods That Are Unresponsive to Reset Commands

Close 

 The Apple AirPods’ factory reset process is a common way to fix a variety of problems ranging from device connection issues to bad audio quality, but it doesn’t always go according to plan. Sometimes the light on the charging case will only flash white instead of amber, while at other times individual AirPods may not be detected at all.

 These fixes apply to both the first and second-generation Apple AirPods and their associated charging cases.

 This guide will walk you through a series of proven solutions for fixing Apple AirPods and their charging case so that you can complete the AirPods’ reset steps and get them working as intended.

##  Causes of Apple AirPods Not Resetting Properly 

 AirPods not resetting properly is usually the result of a damaged charging case or the AirPods not being disconnected from a device. Dirt on the charging case connectors or the AirPods themselves can also prevent the factory rest process from initiating correctly.

This can usually be done on your device's Bluetooth settings or Devices screen.
3. [ Charge the AirPods’ charging case](https://www.lifewire.com/charge-airpods-4768493) . The button on the charging case won’t work if the case’s battery is flat. Charge it fully and then retry the reset process.
