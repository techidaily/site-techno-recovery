## Troubleshoot for installing printers in Windows 10

 Usually, Windows will download and install the printer’s driver automatically. But if the driver provided by Windows isn’t updated to the latest version, there might be some problems.

There are two ways you can update your printer driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (Recommended) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Printers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the[](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-envy-5000-all-in-one-printer-series/14095644/model/14095768) printer’s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.
