## Improvements in Apple's Independent Repair Initiative: What You Need to Know

Apple bucked its reputation of being repair-unfriendly with the launch of its self-repair program, helping owners of Apple devices get official parts and tools for repairs. Now, it has added new devices --- right as people started noticing the company [wasn't really caring about it](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-10-best-funny-videos-on-twitter/).

 Starting tomorrow, Apple's self-service program will begin providing parts and tools for the iPhone 14 lineup, as well as for a range of M2-powered MacBooks, including the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Notably, the newer [15-inch MacBook Air](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-gopro-editing-software-best-15-action-cam-video-editors-for-2024/) is not included yet, and neither seems to be the [14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pros](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-effective-ways-to-capture-and-save-snapchat-media-on-phone/) powered by the M2 Pro and M2 Max. Likewise, the newer Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro desktop computers are also not included.

 It's a start, though, given how many recent devices it lacked. Still, the most recent computers in the list are the M2-powered 13-inch MacBooks, which are already a year old. While you won't run into problems if you have the newer iPhones, you might still be in for a wait if you're looking forward to fixing your own (recently released) Mac.

 The good news, though, is that if you do have a repairable device, it's now getting even easier to fix. As part of this expansion, Apple is making a big change to how System Configuration, the post-repair software tool that validates parts after a repair, works. Now, it no longer requires users to call Apple's support line to validate a repair --- instead, all you need to do after a repair is done is to put the device in diagnostics mode and follow the on-screen prompts.
