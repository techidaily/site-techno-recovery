## What to Know About BlueStacks

 BlueStacks is an Android emulator that works on Windows and macOS. You have other options of Android emulators, but BlueStacks is one of the biggest and most popular choices.

 System requirements for BlueStacks aren't very strenuous, but you'll need at least 4GB of RAM (the developers recommend 8GB). Most CPUs will work just fine, unless you have an older, single-core laptop.

 BlueStacks also runs on macOS. Your Mac needs to run macOS Sierra (10.12) or higher and have an Intel Dual Core processor or better and at least 4GB of RAM.

 Because recent Macs and PCs are generally more powerful than phones, your device should easily meet even the more strenuous, recommended specs for Bluestacks. You likely won't even need to check whether you can run the program unless your computer is especially old.

## Tips and Tricks for Running 'Pokémon Unite'

 In BlueStacks settings, tweaking some values in the**Performance** section can make your gameplay experience smoother. If you have enough RAM and CPU cores to spare, allocating at least 4GB of memory and four CPU cores to BlueStacks is well worth it.

 You should also consider turning every setting in_Pokémon Unite_ itself up to the highest possible level. It isn't a particularly demanding game, so you shouldn't experience much slowdown. Plus, you'll get to enjoy the best graphics available.

 If you aren't happy with the controls on PC, luckily, BlueStacks has a pretty comprehensive keymapping system that'll let you customize your controls to your heart's content. Take some time to read up on the control tweaks BlueStacks offers.
