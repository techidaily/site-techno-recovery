 Apple’s desktop operating system is arguably the best reason to buy a Mac, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. Thankfully, there are plenty of single-use apps to fix, tweak, and add the things that Apple forgot.

## 1 [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) for Snapping Windows 

![Magnet window snapping app for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/magnet-window-snapping-app-for-macos-1.png) 

 Apple has pledged to add native support for window snapping to [macOS 15 Sequoia](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-youtube-editing-essentials-the-ultimate-guide-post-upload-refinements/), but apps like [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) will still have their place. This simple window management app lets you snap windows into position either by dragging or using keyboard shortcuts.

 Magnet costs $4.99 on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) but you can get similar functionality from the basic version of [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com), which is free.

## 2 [TripMode](https://tripmode.ch) for Filtering Hotspot Traffic 

![TripMode personal hotspot filtering app for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tripmode-personal-hotspot-filtering-app-for-macos.png) 

 If you ever use an iPhone personal hotspot to work on your MacBook remotely, you’re probably aware of how quickly you can burn through data. [TripMode](https://tripmode.ch) is an app that filters traffic whenever it detects that you are connected to a cellular hotspot.

 By default, traffic will be blocked. This allows you to create an allow-list of apps that are mission-critical. You can then block the heavy hitters like Photos or your Mac’s background cloud syncing processes. Try it for free and then buy a single-use license for $17.

## 3 [Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) for Recalling Clipboard Items 

![Maccy clipboard manager for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/maccy-clipboard-manager-for-macos.png) 

 Maccy is a clipboard manager for macOS that you can download for free from the project’s [GitHub page](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) or for $9.99 on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/maccy/id1527619437?mt=12). The app stores your clipboard history for easy retrieval, with a global hotkey (by default Command+Shift+C) for quickly accessing the app.

 The app is well-optimized so performance is solid, and you can easily customize things like how many items are saved (by default 200) and what the app looks like. You can even pin items to your clipboard for frequent retrieval.

## 4 [MacMediaKeyForwarder](https://github.com/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder) to Fix the Play/Pause Key 

![MediaKeyForwarder app for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mediakeyforwarder-app-for-macos.png) 

 Apple’s media keys can be a little erratic. I like to listen to music using Apple Music while I work, but sometimes I find myself with random YouTube tabs open. It’s frustrating when pressing the Play/Pause key starts or stops a YouTube video instead. [MacMediaKeyForwarder](https://github.com/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder) is an app that solves this problem.

 The app limits the Play/Pause key behavior to Apple’s Music app or Spotify. No longer will pressing this key start random videos on background tabs!

## 5 [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) to Keep My Mac Awake 

![Amphetamine app for keeping a Mac awake.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/amphetamine-app-for-keeping-a-mac-awake.png) 

 Sometimes you need to keep your Mac awake, and [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) is the answer. This highly configurable free app is designed to prevent your Mac from sleeping, allowing you to keep your Mac awake in a variety of situations.

 The app lets you sleep the screen but keep your Mac running, keep everything awake so that the screen remains on, or even close the lid without putting your MacBook to sleep (which requires the free [Amphetamine-Enhancer](https://github.com/x74353/Amphetamine-Enhancer) add-on). You can configure triggers and hotkeys, use the app as a [mouse jiggler](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-optimizing-video-content-with-powerful-hashtags-on-youtube/), and more.

## 6 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for Installing Software via Terminal 

![Installing a command-line utility using Homebrew for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/installing-a-command-line-utility-using-homebrew-for-macos.png) 

 There are [many ways to install software on your Mac](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-streaming-services-face-off-facebook-youtube-and-spaces/), but the easiest method is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). This package manager lets you install full applications and command-line utilities with a single command, and can even keep things updated for you.

 Some applications and utilities rely on Homebrew as their primary method of installation, so it’s a good utility to have installed. Check out [our full guide to getting started with Homebrew](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-virtualvista-viewers-verdict/) on your Mac and install it now by running the following command in Terminal:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

## 7 [Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) for Testing Internet Speed 

![Speedtest CLI running in Terminal on macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/speedtest-cli-running-in-terminal-on-macos.png) 

 Speedtest by Ookla is one of the most popular internet speed test services, but it can be a drag having to open a new tab, navigate to the website, and click the “Go” button. The fastest way is to [use the companion command-line utility](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/fading-audio-dynamics-a-logic-pro-approach/).

 First, install Homebrew (using the instructions above), and then install the official Speedtest command-line utility by running the following command in Terminal:

brew install speedtest-cli

 Once the app has been installed, you can run a full internet speed test in Terminal any time you want using the following simple command:

speedtest-cli

 The utility has a variety of flags so you can do things like specify a server, or exclude upload or download speeds. Check these out by running:

speedtest-cli -help

## 8 [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) for Writing in Markdown 

![Writing in Markdown in Ulysses.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulysses_markdown.png) 

[I write almost everything in Markdown](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-activation-lock-on-the-apple-iphone-se-2020-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios/), a lightweight markup language with easy inline text formatting. This makes it easy to publish on the web or export to HTML and other formats, but it’s also great for personal offline writing too. My app of choice is [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), a premium Markdown editor that costs $5.99 per month

 Paying for a writing app makes sense if you’re being paid for your writing, but this isn’t ideal for everyone. Fortunately, there are some great free Markdown editors to choose from, with [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) being a personal favorite.

## 9  Apple Notes for Organizing My Life 

![Apple Notes on macOS](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple_notes.png) 

 I don’t pay for a fancy note-taking app, Apple’s pack-in app has everything I need. It doesn’t support Markdown ([you’ll need an app like Obsidian for that](https://howto.techidaily.com/fixing-persistent-pandora-crashes-on-vivo-y36i-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/)), but it covers the basics like syncing with my iPhone so I’ve got everything I need on me wherever I am. It also supports advanced features like collaboration and supporting inter-note linking.

[Switching from Evernote to Apple Notes](https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-tiktokplusinstagram-social-media-fusion-guide-for-2024/) was one of the best things I did to improve personal organization. If you also rely on Android or Windows you might want to check out [our note-taking app roundup](https://games-able.techidaily.com/sonys-ps5-dualsense-controller-excellence-with-new-chargers/) for some better recommendations.

## 10 [Hyperkey](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/) for Boosting Keyboard Shortcuts 

![HyperKey for macOS for improving shortcut options.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hyperkey-for-macos-for-improving-shortcut-options.png) 

 Ever feel like you’re running out of keyboard shortcuts? You can always use a longer modifier combination like Control+Option+Command (and even add Shift), but things get complicated fast. An easier method is to use the [Hyperkey](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/) app to [repurpose your Caps Lock key as a “hyper” key](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/) that triggers these modifiers for you.

 Then all you need to do is assign some shortcuts that depend on your new “hyper” key. So, for example, Instead of hitting Shift+Control+Option+Command+R to trigger a Shortcut, you can just hit Caps Lock+R instead.

## 11 [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com) for Extracting Archives 

![The file association options on Unarchiver.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mac-unarchiver-options.png) 

 Perhaps the most boring app on this list, [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com) is a free app that adds support for archive formats that aren’t supported in macOS by default like RAR and 7Z. It can also unpack deprecated formats from forgotten platforms, and do interesting things like extract images and audio from SWF files.

 It’s not exciting, but it’s essential. Download it for free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12) so it’s there when you need it.

## 12 [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) for Customizing the Keyboard 

![Karabiner-Elements keyboard customization tool for macOS.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/karabiner-elements-keyboard-customization-tool-for-macos.png) 

 If you want to customize your Mac’s keyboard mappings then look no further than [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org). Use a simple GUI to remap what any key does, and create separate rules for different keyboards. You can create your own tweaks and rules, disable keys entirely, or [make that useless Eject key useful again](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-adobe-cloud-essential-storage-insights-and-top-alternatives/).

 The app also supports more complicated modifications, allowing you to do things like preventing accidental application quitting by changing Command+Q to instead requiring that you double-tap Q. There are hundreds of these rules available on the [Karabiner-Elements community website](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org) read that you can import with a click.
