If my week of testing the new [Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian%2F6587911.p%3FskuId%3D6587911&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) has taught me anything, it's that sequels can, in fact, be better than the original. After a rocky start with last year's [Pixel Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-fold-review/), Google has gone back to the drawing board, etched out a new foldable that is more polished, user-friendly, and feature-packed, and is hoping that you'll buy into its $1,799 master plan again. For me... it almost succeeds. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Google's latest smartphones feature brighter displays, improved camera hardware and features, and a host of creative AI tools. View at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian%2F6587911.p%3FskuId%3D6587911&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1)

It's only been a week, so I'm not 100% sold on Google's foldable phone just yet. Still, after re-using the Pixel Fold in preparation for this review, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels much easier to recommend to enthusiasts than its predecessor, with upgrades in arguably every way, from the slimmer, taller display to the brighter panels to the Tensor G4 chip that powers Google's other [flagship phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-google-phone/) this year.

These three aspects alone may be enough to entice [Pixel Fold users to make the switch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold/). I certainly would.

**Also: [I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra with the Pixel 9 Pro XL for two weeks - and can't go back](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-pixel-9-pro-xl-for-two-weeks-and-cant-go-back/)**

Of course, the new look won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you prefer the shorter, boxier design of last year's version. Google likes to compare the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with the [Pixel 9 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-799-google-pixel-9-is-the-real-star-of-this-years-android-phone-lineup/), both of which field 6.3-inch Super Actua displays.

Once you factor in the former's side hinge, thicker bezels, and folded screen, however, the two don't feel as close as the numbers suggest. I wouldn't call the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a great one-handed device, but its thin design -- which gives me [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surface-duo-review-why-im-still-confused-about-microsofts-dual-screen-device/) vibes -- certainly helps.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's thinness also helps make the eight-inch internal display all the more glorious when unfolded. This is the closest you'll ever come to the "tablet in your pocket" dream.

I know we're talking decimal points between the Pixel, [Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-z-fold6%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-z-fold6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakexaa%2F%3F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and the [OnePlus Open](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-open%3Fsku%3D5011110016&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), but the dimensions of the Google phone truly feel like an Android tablet when open, and I love it for streaming YouTube videos and TV shows, playing games, and multitasking.

**Also: [Why the $799 Google Pixel 9 is the real star of this year's Android phone lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-799-google-pixel-9-is-the-real-star-of-this-years-android-phone-lineup/)**

Notice I didn't mention "movies" in that sequence. That's because the wider, 21:9 aspect ratio of most films means the letterboxing (black bars that fill any dead space) on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's squarish display is _very_ prominent. It's more-letterboxing-than-the-actual-video prominent.

Fortunately, the speakers are loud and clear, and the ability to unfold completely flat means the center crease is less noticeable this year, reducing any visual distraction.

The letterboxing on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is big and bold. For what it's worth, the YouTube app does apply a gradient layer to accommodate the colors of the video.

For multitasking, you're limited to split-screening two apps, with Google still against you having three or more apps open at once -- whether through split layouts or floating windows. This remains the Pixel's biggest setback against competing [phone-to-tablet foldables](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-lets-break-down-the-differences/), especially when Samsung and OnePlus are being more adventurous with their big-screen capabilities. Because of this limitation, the Tensor G4 chip naturally handles the most "extraneous" workflows on this device.

That's not to say that Google _isn't_ trying with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The 16GB of RAM, Tensor G4 chip, and breadth of [Gemini-powered AI features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-google-thinks-will-sell-you-on-its-latest-pixel-phones-including-the-fold/) make it clear that the device was built for the times.

**Also: [Every Google Pixel 9 model compared: Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-google-pixel-9-model-compared-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-xl-and-pixel-9-pro-fold/)**

In fact, I've enjoyed using Google's latest AI services on the big screen even more than on its Pixel 9 Pro, for at least three reasons, as listed in below:

* **Pixel Screenshots**: More photos can populate as you type specific words, names, places, and other queries.
* **Reimagine** (and other Magic Editor features): The larger canvas makes it easier to pinpoint subjects to remove, resize, or reimagine.
* **Gemini**: Split-screening with Gemini Live or its chatbot app is like running [Copilot on Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-copilot/). Just this weekend, I learned the dos and don'ts of refinancing a home mortgage from Gemini while texting my lender.

In my testing, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold remained functional even when I held it beneath the summer sun. The 2,700 nits of brightness on this year's model is a major win, especially when compared to the Pixel Fold's mere 1,450 nits, which made text illegible outdoors.

I've also noticed the refresh rate remaining mostly at 120Hz, with less throttling than on the standard Pixel 9, even as I'm updating a game in the background or scrolling through a Reddit feed full of videos and images. The user experience on the Pixel has been very smooth.

Split screening with two apps is the limit for multitasking on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

If you were hoping to experience the cutting edge of camera tech with the $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold, you'd be just as disappointed as those who hoped for the same last year. That's because the new Google foldable carries nearly every sensor from the previous Pixel Fold, including the 48MP main lens and 10MP selfie cameras.

The ultrawide and telephoto lenses are down to 10.5MP (from 11MP) but field similar apertures and capturing capabilities. The funny thing is, even with the year-old hardware, the Pixel still shoots the most natural-looking, well-contrasted photos and videos of all the foldables I've tested.

**Also: [The camera accessory I recommend to most people is not a tripod or microphone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-camera-accessory-i-recommend-to-most-people-is-not-a-tripod-or-microphone/)**

Still, compared to the new [Pixel 9 Pro series](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-pixel-9-pro-xl-for-two-weeks-and-cant-go-back/), the Fold falls flat in detail and color reproduction. See the image sample below, which compares the output from the 48MP and 50MP wide sensors on the Fold and 9 Pro, respectively. The colors captured by the Fold appear more washed out (read: the flower petals are a lighter shade of pink). When zooming in, you can really see where details get lost, like on the flower tag.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Instead of buffing the hardware, Google has added new software features like Made You Look, Add Me, and Video Boost to expand the Pixel 9 Pro Fold camera system's capabilities. Made You Look displays dynamic animations on the outer screen to get the attention of your subject -- ideally, a toddler or pet -- as you capture the photo.

It _almost_ works. Because the rear cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are not directly above the outer display, subjects often stare more rightward, appearing as if they're distracted by a passerby.

Notice where the rear cameras are positioned when Look At Me is in use.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

I also wish you could use Add Me, which stitches two images captured by two different people to include everyone in the same photo, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is in Tabletop Mode. Being able to set the phone still would make the framing of the photos nearly identical. You wouldn't need an AR overlay to guide the framing, significantly reducing user error. Instead, the feature now requires that you click twice and hope that the AI will piece everyone together.

Lastly, the 4,650mAh battery on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been enough to get me through a day, with roughly 18% to 20% left. That's about average by today's flagship phone standards but much better than last year's Pixel Fold, which I found myself recharging before nighttime. It helps that the outer display feels more like a traditional smartphone's, meaning I've felt less of an urge to open up the phone and use the more power-consuming inner display. 

## ZDNET's buying advice

The [Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian%2F6587911.p%3FskuId%3D6587911&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) has nearly everything a Pixel user could want in a foldable, from the simplistic user experience to the reliable camera system to the seven years of software support. I'm a fan of the new, slimmer, and lighter design, which earns the title of being the thinnest foldable in the US.

Under a $1,800 magnifying glass, however, it's hard not to nitpick all the ways Google could've made the phone better. Having the same (if not similar) camera system as the other Pixel "Pro" phones would be a start. 

For the best deal on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I'd consider [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Fold-Obsidian-Amazon%2Fdp%2FB0DBW3RBPT%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cd47d83f4-3ff3-4f11-8569-647ee6cf90fb%7Cdtp&dtb=1) or [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian%2F6587911.p%3FskuId%3D6587911&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), both of which offer you a $350 gift card with your purchase.
