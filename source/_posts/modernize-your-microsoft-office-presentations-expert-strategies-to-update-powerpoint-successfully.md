##  How Can I Update My PowerPoint for Free?

 No matter which version of PowerPoint you have, Microsoft has probably released a few updates since you installed it. If you have Microsoft 365, PowerPoint should install updates automatically by default as long as you're online, but you can also manually check for updates:

1. Open a new slide and select the**File** tab.  
![The File tab in PowerPoint for Office 365.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZpEERr9qAOki5MD0wJifbR4qCYQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_update-powerpoint-5209548-2c52373488bd4a9d8cb8ee53865328b4.jpg)  
 On Mac, go to**Help** \>**Check for Updates** . You can also go to the App Store and look under**Updates** to see if PowerPoint updates are available.
2. Select**Account** .

 In older versions of PowerPoint, select**Help** .
3. Select**Update Options** \>**Update Now** or**Check for Updates** (depending on your version).  
![Update Now in PowerPoint for Office 365.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/CQYo4uN70heac9oQ8mn5aGGa6fs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_update-powerpoint-5209548-4c626a6bc6154eb0a63a1d52604db930.jpg)
4. After PowerPoint installs updates, you'll have the option to enable automatic updates (if it's not already enabled).  
 Mac users can download the Microsoft AutoUpdate tool to keep all their Office apps up to date. You can also refresh Microsoft apps by[ running Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) .

##  How Do I Download the Latest Version of PowerPoint?

 If you want to upgrade to a newer version of PowerPoint, you must purchase PowerPoint from Microsoft or subscribe to Microsoft 365\. You can also buy Office 2021 from Microsoft if you want Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint all in one package.

 A Microsoft 365 subscription gives you access to all Office apps (Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.) for an annual fee. You can use the latest version of PowerPoint and try new features as they get released. The downside is you have to renew your subscription every year.

 With the standalone version of PowerPoint, you'll still get occasional updates, but you may miss out on the newest features. The upside is you own the software, so you never need to renew the license. Either way, Microsoft offers free trials and discounts for students.

 To see which version of PowerPoint you have, go to**File** \>**Account** \>**About PowerPoint** .

##  Do I Need to Update PowerPoint?

 Microsoft occasionally releases[ patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) to address bugs and make PowerPoint more reliable. These updates are usually minor, but they are still essential to keep PowerPoint functioning properly. Wherever you're having[ problems with PowerPoint](https://www.lifewire.com/solving-common-powerpoint-problems-2767411) , updating the program could resolve the issue.

 Microsoft no longer releases updates for older versions of PowerPoint, so if you're still using a discontinued version like PowerPoint 2010, you should consider upgrading. More recent editions of the program, like PowerPoint 2021, feature tools and effects you won't find in outdated versions.

 If you have a slide made in an older version of PowerPoint, you can open it in a newer version and take advantage of the latest tools and features.
