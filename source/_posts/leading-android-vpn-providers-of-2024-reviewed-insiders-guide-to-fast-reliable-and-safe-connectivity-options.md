## What is the best Android VPN in 2024?

[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&aff%5Fid=307&source=ZDNET&offer%5Fid=378) is our top pick for the best Android VPN right now. It offers capabilities beyond basic [VPN services](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) with a high level of security, it's popular, and with a 30-day money-back guarantee, it's worth a try. 

There are other great VPNs for Android you could consider. Together with other ZDNET authors, [I've been testing VPNs for years](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/), during which I've compared over a dozen [VPNs on their speed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-vpn/), security, the usability of their mobile interfaces, and the server networks on offer.

An Android VPN lets you browse the internet anonymously, access geo-restricted content, and avoid being tracked by advertisers, hackers, and government surveillance -- making it a key tool for your privacy. The best services won't noticeably impact your speed or take up too much of your smartphone's resources.

### NordVPN

#### Best Android VPN overall

NordVPN is one of the most popular consumer VPNs in the Google Play Store, but that is not why we think it's the best VPN for Android. It offers rock-solid performance and speed that carried it across the finish line.

NordVPN supports peer-to-peer file sharing, streaming, and a number of other platforms outside of Android. Its Onion over VPN feature removes the need for a separate [Tor browser](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-tor-browser-and-why-you-should/). There are also add-ons available, including a dedicated IP address, password manager, encrypted cloud storage, cyber protection coverage, and a data breach scanner. 

This VPN provides 10 simultaneous connections under one account and a server network with access to 111 countries. Its speed is excellent, and you will likely have no problem connecting to streaming services, including [Netflix](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-netflix-vpn/) or [Amazon Fire TV Stick](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-firestick/).

During our testing, NordVPN connected quickly and reliably to servers, although you'll want to use the smart connect feature for the best performance. If you're still not 100% sold on choosing NordVPN, you can try it out with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Customers like the speed and stability of the VPN, and say support is top-notch.

**Review:** [**NordVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nord-vpn-review-an-in-depth-look-at-a-popular-vpn/)

Prices start at $3.59 per month if you purchase two years of service upfront, $4.99 per month for a one-year plan, or $12.99 for a month-to-month subscription for basic protection. New users who subscribe to a two-year plan will receive three months of access free.

### Surfshark VPN

#### Best budget Android VPN

Surfshark is the best option for a cheap Android VPN that will keep your mobile data secure and mask your activities.

In our speed testing, we found Surfshark's performance to be reasonable, especially considering its price point. Surfshark is extremely easy to use, has a robust server and country network with 100 countries to choose from, unlimited simultaneous connections, and will suit many users for day-to-day surfing. 

The VPN also offers MultiHop, a feature that creates a more secure connection by routing you through two VPNs. A whitelist function allows apps and devices to bypass the VPN on your Android device. Additional complimentary tools include ad-blocking, anti-tracking, and [split tunneling](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-vpn-split-tunneling/). 

**Review**: [**Surfshark VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

Surfshark is one of the [most affordable VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-vpn/) on the market, with two-year plans starting at $2.19/month, plus three months of free access. Yearly plans offer the same number of free months and begin at $2.99 per month. Monthly signups are expensive, ranging from $15.45 to $17.95.

A seven-day trial is available for Android devices.

****Surfshark VPN Android features:** Google Play Store rating: 4.5 average, 116K reviews | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Countries: 100 | Kill switch: Yes | Native app support: Android 5 or higher | Logging: None, except billing data | Money-back guarantee: 30 days, seven-day Android trial

Pros 
* Speedy connections
* Large server network
* No logs
* Trial available

Cons 
* More expensive than its competitors

### ExpressVPN

#### Best Android VPN for speed

ExpressVPN is a popular VPN service that made our list due to its generally high speeds, expansive server network, and user-friendly app for Android devices.

ExpressVPN has servers in 105 countries, so you can easily find a server to connect to wherever you are. This is one of the largest that VPN providers currently offer. During our testing, we found that ExpressVPN has some of the fastest and most stable connections and consistently fast speeds. As a bonus, the Android app is very user-friendly.

In addition to supporting Android 5 and above, ExpressVPN works with various platforms and browser extensions, and an APK is available. Therefore, you should be able to use its app regardless of which devices you own, and you can use this VPN for far more than your Android smartphone or tablet.

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

Subscription costs begin at $6.67 per month if you buy a year of service upfront. As a bonus, ExpressVPN will also give you three months for free, added to the end of the contract term, and Backblaze cloud backup. Alternatively, you could pay $9.99/month for six months of access or $12.95 on a month-to-month basis. 

A seven-day trial for Android devices is available. Customers say that while this VPN isn't the cheapest, it offers excellent speeds, a good server network, and solid customer support. 

**ExpressVPN Android features:** Google Play Store rating: 4.3 average, 73K reviews | Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Native app support: Android 5 or higher | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Countries: 105 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days, seven day Android trial

Pros 
* Open source

Network  35,000 servers in 91 countries

Jurisdiction  United States

Price  $40 per year or $12 per month (3-year plans available at $79 every three years)

### Private Internet Access

#### Best open source Android VPN

Private Internet Access is another solid VPN choice for your Android phone. 

It doesn't have the most attractive user interface, but it is easy to understand and server selection -- of which you can choose from 91 locations -- is reasonable. Our testing indicates that the speed is what I would call mid-tier, but the VPN connects quickly, and I have experienced no unexpected drops or lagging.

There is a no-logs policy and as a bonus, PIA supports WireGuard and is open source, which means that third parties can examine its code and flag any security or privacy issues. 

**Review: [Private Internet Access](https://www.zdnet.com/article/private-internet-access-review/)**

Customers generally like the service and its connectivity, but some note issues with customer service. You can sign up for a two-year plan for the equivalent of $2.19/month (two months free), a six-month plan for $7.50/month, or one month of access will cost you $11.99\. A 30-day money-back guarantee is available.

****Private Internet Access VPN Android features:** Google Play Store rating: 4.3 average, 87K reviews | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Native app support: Android 5 and up | Logging: None, except billing data | Locations: 91 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days

Pros 
* Unlimited connections
* Fast connection speed
* Flexible with a wide range of protocols
* Stylish UI

Cons 
* Limited server network

### IPVanish

#### Best click-and-go Android VPN

IPVanish seems to market itself as a click-and-go VPN service, but it's much more than that. In terms of performance, IPVanish excels with fast connection speeds and solid transfers.

A bonus of this VPN is its stylish app user interface, which not only looks good but is also quite easy to navigate. IPVanish also features a variety of protocols and server options, and there are extensive options for configuring the app itself. Overall, IPVanish delivers a solid user experience and VPN service compared to many other options on the market, although its downside is its limited country availability.

**Review:** [**IPVanish**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review-a-rich-wealth-of-options-and-surfing-controls/)

If you commit to two years, IPVanish offers a discounted plan for $2.19 per month. This increases to $2.79 per month for an annual plan and $12.99 for a month-to-month subscription. Once your deal ends, you should keep an eye on the price hike, unless you've chosen to turn off automatic renewal.

****IPVanish VPN Android features:** Google Play Store rating: 4.2 average, 58K reviews | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Native app support: Android 5.1 and up | Logging: None, except billing data | Locations: 75 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days

## What is an Android VPN service and why should you use one?

We use our smartphones to access sensitive information and conduct online transactions more often than ever before, so staying secure on the internet while on the go is essential.

While you might focus your security on [laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) and home PCs, you shouldn't forget that your [smartphone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) is often the key to your digital kingdom. It may be used to access personal email accounts and hubs, work resources, social media, and financial services -- and if you fail to protect it, you may be more at risk of having your accounts compromised.

With the right VPN, you can browse the internet anonymously, access geo-restricted content, and avoid being tracked by advertisers, hackers, and government surveillance.

**See also: [What is a VPN and why do you need one?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-why-do-you-need-one-all-your-virtual-private-network-questions-answered/)**

Google's Android operating system is embedded in billions of devices worldwide, including smartphones, [tablets](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablet/), [Chromebooks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-chromebook-laptop/), and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Android functions on a broad range of products, most of which are internet-connected, so it follows that VPN providers support this OS.

An Android VPN service is a virtual private network service that encrypts your internet traffic, hides your IP address, and provides you with an anonymous and secure connection while you're using your Android device. These may include smartphones and tablets manufactured by companies including Google, Samsung, and Motorola.

## How to set up an Android VPN

Once you've chosen the VPN you want to install, go to the Google Play Store and search for it. In most cases, you'll be able to download the VPN app directly from the Google Play Store, but you may have to download it from the VPN provider's site. (If this is the case, please make sure you trust the vendor and domain.) 

For this example, I will be downloading and installing ExpressVPN on a [Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review/).

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

After the app is downloaded, you can install it, but you may have to provide the VPN with specific device permissions. Open it and log in to the service with your username/email and password you created when you subscribed.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Once your VPN has been installed, select a country or choose quick connect, and you're done!

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

In rare cases, you may have to manually set up a VPN service on your device. Most VPN providers have extensive FAQ sections on their sites with details on how to complete a manual setup. It's best to reference those instructions for the specific VPN you're using, and to contact support if you have any issues.

## How we test VPNs

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been talking about various VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

While ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, we can't test from all locations. Every home, every community, every local ISP, and every nation has a different infrastructure. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for Android below using the following criteria that are most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you'd need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point using a VPN unless their security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our Android VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive mobile apps.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.

## What are the factors to consider when choosing an Android VPN?

When you are selecting your new Android VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Price**: You need to consider the overall cost of your new VPN plan. Try to take advantage of promotions, but ignore countdown timers -- they typically are just marketing tools. While top-notch VPNs can cost upwards of $10/month, many are available for only a few dollars per month. Many VPN providers will also give you a free seven-day Android trial. We generally recommend that free VPNs are avoided -- with a few exceptions -- as they may sell your data or bombard you with ads.
* **Simultaneous connections**: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your Android phone, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or a laptop. We recommend you sign up for a plan with support for at least six devices. Thankfully, many paid VPN plans now offer unlimited connections.
* **Speed**: Speed is of paramount importance when you want to use a VPN for certain use cases. If you plan to use your new Android VPN for streaming or mobile gaming, choose one with minimal speed loss.
* **Contract length**: You also need to decide how long you want a VPN for. If you opt for a two-year term, you tend to secure the best prices, but there are other options available. After you've made a selection, you typically get a 30-day money-back guarantee.
* **Support**: As with any subscription software, you may come across problems with installation, use, or when it is time to renew or cancel. We list VPNs with a support team available.
* **Apps**: When selecting a VPN, you need to try it out first to ensure you like its accompanying Android app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but lack in the mobile app department, which may not be as intuitive or easy to use.
* **Free trial**: Don't forget that many VPN providers will give you a week to try out their Android VPNs for free. Visit the Google Play Sore and download the options you like and find the right app for you.

## What is the best free VPN for Android?

We do not typically recommend free VPN services due to their general lack of reliability and heavy restrictions. Several free VPNs for Android are, however, supported by premium paid subscriptions and are provided by trustworthy organizations. 

These free services are sometimes offered by reputable VPNs and are generally safe to use, but they usually have severe data or performance limits, making them useful only as a way to test out the full service. 

We recommend Proton VPN's free service, which has no data caps, or Windscribe, a trustworthy free service. That said, Proton VPN restricts your speed, whereas Windscribe imposes a data cap.

## Does Android have a built-in VPN?

The Android operating does have a [VPN client](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/9213914) that supports PPTP, L2TP/IPSec, and IPSec protocols. The client is typically used for accessing private networks, such as when you need a VPN to connect to work [resources](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9089766#zippy=%2Cadd-a-saved-network) \-- and you will need details provided by an administrator to use it. Most users will not need to enable this function and will, instead, download a VPN mobile app.

Some vendors have built upon the native Android client to offer tailored VPN functions. Samsung is among them, and the company's own VPN solution has been made available through the Samsung Knox security framework. This service is focused on mobile device management, the enterprise, and developers, rather than consumers. Still, if you're interested, you can check out Samsung's guide to enabling VPN services [here](https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/knox-service-plugin/kbas/kba-785-how-to-configure-the-knox-built-in-vpn/).

## Why do I even need a VPN on my Android phone?

Most people's phone data runs through a local carrier, which is difficult for hackers to intercept. Generally, you're reasonably safe if you're using your carrier's cellular connection, but carriers have data caps and data carriage fees that can get expensive. Even if you have an unlimited data plan, carriers might charge you for hotspot use.

To avoid extra costs, you can use local Wi-Fi that coffee shops, airport lounges, hotels, and schools often offer for free. Unfortunately, these Wi-Fi hotspots are often open and easy to intercept. Having a [VPN on your phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mobile-vpn/) can protect your data when accessing the internet through one of these hotspots. In fact, I recommend never accessing the internet through a Wi-Fi hotspot without an active VPN.

Furthermore, you may want to consider using a VPN to stay secure and to be able to pick your preferred location if you are using your Android device to stream content.

## How do I tell if my VPN is safe?

To check if your VPN is safe and working properly, first choose a reputable vendor known to have a strong security background.

The easiest way to check that your VPN is working properly is to compare your IP address before and after enabling a VPN connection. You can find this under your device's settings (typically under Wi-Fi) or by visiting [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). If they both display the same IP, your VPN may not be working properly. 

You can also visit [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to see if any DNS leaks have been detected while you are using a VPN, which could be a sign that your information is being leaked. 

Finally, be careful with free VPNs offered by unknown or shady companies, especially if they are outside of official app repositories. This could open your device up to surveillance or malware.

## How do I turn off my VPN on Android?

ZDNET | Charlie Osborne

The easiest way to [turn off your VPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-off-a-vpn-on-most-devices/) on Android is to open the VPN's app and choose to disconnect. Alternatively, you can go to your Android device's settings tab, select network (which may appear as connections or connection settings) and select "VPN." Depending on your device, this may show a list of all apps with VPN profiles. From here, you can change the VPN's settings or turn it off. 

## What's the difference between antivirus or anti-malware software and VPN software?

While these technologies are intended to protect you and your device, they provide different layers of protection. VPNs fundamentally protect data in motion, which is sent to and from the internet. VPN protection is generally provided by encryption, so hackers can't spy on the data while it moves. Some providers will also bolt on malware scanners, data breach monitors, and more. 

Anti-malware software protects against malicious software executing on your device. Those apps scan data, monitor running software processes and downloads, and may intercept suspicious activities or downloads. They may also include checking permissions and ensuring apps don't have more control over your device than they need.

A VPN is not a one-size-fits-all solution to mobile security, but it is an important part of overall mobile security hygiene and data protection.

## Are Android VPN services legal?

Android VPN services are legal in the US, but the legality of using VPNs varies from country to country. It is important to check the laws of your location before using a VPN. Some countries ban their use outright, such as North Korea, Belarus, and Iraq, whereas other countries frown upon the use of any VPN that is not state-controlled -- including Russia and China.

For a list of countries where VPN usage is illegal, check out NordVPN's [guide](https://nordvpn.com/blog/are-vpns-legal/).

## Does a VPN affect phone calls?

You shouldn't experience any disruption when you receive or place a phone call while you are using a VPN. 

A VPN will not encrypt or protect your phone calls. If you want to mask these forms of communication, you will need another solution, such as a protected Voice over IP (VoIP) service.

## Does a VPN hide your location?

Yes, in relation to your IP address. Some VPNs also offer GPS spoofing. If a VPN is working properly, it will assign you a new IP address to make it appear that you are in a different location, which could be in your country, state, or somewhere else around the world.
