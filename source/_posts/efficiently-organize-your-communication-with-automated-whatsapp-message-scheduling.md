 My friends used to get upset with me because I always forgot to wish them happy birthday exactly at midnight. It’s not that I don’t care about wishing them a happy birthday, but I always get caught up in something else. To avoid this and prevent missing other events, I’ve started scheduling messages on WhatsApp.

##  Schedule WhatsApp Messages on Android

 No, WhatsApp hasn't released an official way to schedule messages. However, many third-party apps on the [Play Store](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/enhancements-made-in-the-latest-fix-for-football-manager-2020-reliable-performance-guaranteed/) can help you schedule WhatsApp messages on your Android smartphone. SKEDit is one of the best options available.

 To use SKEDit, first [download it from the Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004171/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codefish.sqedit&hl=en%5FUS) and grant it the necessary permissions, which includes permission to disable the smart lock on your Android smartphone so the app can send the message without your intervention. After that, tap the plus icon and select "WhatsApp." Then, choose the person you want to send the scheduled message to by selecting the "Recipients" option.

Close 

 Type your message in the message field and add any attachments if needed. Next, select the date and time for the scheduled message and tap the check icon at the top.

Close 

 That's it! The app will automatically send the scheduled message without requiring any further input from you.

##  Schedule WhatsApp Messages on iPhone

 On your iPhone, you can use the Shortcuts app to schedule a WhatsApp or any other [text message](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-enhanced-engagement-with-effective-youtube-video-outros-strategies-for-2024/). If you don't have the app installed on your iPhone, [download it from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) and then open it. Tap "Automation" at the bottom and choose "New Automation." Then, select "Time of Day."

##  Schedule WhatsApp Messages on WhatsApp Web

 WhatsApp competitor [Telegram](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-stop-parent-tracking-your-realme-12plus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) has had the message scheduling feature for a while. So, it's very likely that this feature will eventually be added to WhatsApp. Until then, you can use the workarounds discussed above to schedule messages on WhatsApp.
