The original [Apple Watch Ultra](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-ultra-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-alpine-loop-large-titanium%2F6339710.p%3FskuId%3D6339710&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) is getting a rare $160 discount for the holidays. Released one year ago, Apple's outdoor adventure smartwatch is now on sale for $639, down from its usual $799 price. This deal is available at Best Buy for the 49mm Titanium Case model. 

If you have been thinking about getting yourself or a loved one a new [Apple Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/), now is the time to snag a great deal on the top-performing high-end model.

The [Ultra series](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-review/) is Apple's most rugged and capable watch line. While the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/), released this fall, is the latest version, the [Apple Watch Ultra](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-ultra-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-alpine-loop-large-titanium%2F6339710.p%3FskuId%3D6339710&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) continues to be an incredibly capable smartwatch that you can buy for a significantly lower price. 

When comparing the smartwatches, ZDNET's wearable expert Matthew Miller notes the Ultra 2 does not have any major improvements compared to its predecessor -- the biggest differences are the brighter display and the new processor.

When testing the [Apple Watch Ultra](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-ultra-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-alpine-loop-large-titanium%2F6339710.p%3FskuId%3D6339710&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), Miller put it through the most ruthless endurance test he could think of: a Tough Mudder 15K. He found the Ultra watch held up impressively well, especially since he completed the challenge without getting a single scratch in the display. During the Mudder, the watch updated Miller about one-mile splits, tracked his workouts, notified him of his heart rate, and identified several times when he had taken a hard hit, asking if he needed assistance. 

ZDNET reviewer Adrian Kingsley Hughes also [tested the Apple Watch Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-tough-is-the-apple-watch-ultra-i-stress-tested-it-for-9-months/) for nine months, and wrote that he was "impressed there \[wasn't\] more damage to the case."
