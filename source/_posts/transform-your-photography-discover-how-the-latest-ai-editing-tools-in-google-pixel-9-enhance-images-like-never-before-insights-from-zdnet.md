At this year's [Made by Google event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/), Google announced its latest hardware, including the Pixel 9 lineup. The smartphones are naturally loaded with new AI features, and -- as with Google's past launches -- some of the most standout features are related to photo editing.

A great camera is only part of what it takes to capture great photos, as factors like framing, lighting, backdrop -- and the photographer! -- are equally important. That's where these new AI features can help.

Read below for a roundup of the best AI photo editing features announced today and coming to the new Pixel phones. 

## 1\. Add Me 

If you're not in a picture, perhaps it's because you were taking the photo yourself. With Google's new Add Me feature, you can use AI to edit yourself into the photo. The feature will merge a photo of the group with a photo of the photographer alone to create a new image of everyone together.

You can then combine the feature with the Best Take feature released with the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro last year. With Best Take, you can select your favorite expressions for each person from a series of similar photos. Combining both features should ensure everyone has a result they love, even if it wasn't how the picture was originally taken.

## 2\. Reimagine

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

In the era of [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), there wouldn't truly be an AI feature launch if an [AI image generator](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-image-generator/) wasn't included in some capacity. Reimagine is a feature that lets you easily add effects and edit existing photos via simple text prompts and the power of generative AI.

All you have to do is tap the area you want to change and type what you want to see. Some sample prompts could include "add sunset" or "make the grass greener."

## 3\. Updated Magic Editor 

Magic Editor has new capabilities powered by AI. Now, it can reframe your photo automatically, suggest the best crop, and even expand your image to get more out of your shot. This particular feature is useful when a picture you took has potential, but the framing was less than ideal.

This adds to the already extensive suite of editing tools available in Magic Editor, such as the ability to remove and move objects, edit backgrounds, and more.

## Bonus: Pixel 9 Pro updated Video Boost

The Pixel 9 Pro has an updated Video Boost feature, allowing you to upgrade your video quality to an 8K resolution. This will greatly benefit videographers and content creators who need their smartphones to produce the best possible video quality.
