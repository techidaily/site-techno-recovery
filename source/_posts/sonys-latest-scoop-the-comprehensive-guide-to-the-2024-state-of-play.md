 Sony’s State of Play event happens semi-regularly whenever the company has big news or product announcements about PlayStation. The inaugural event was in 2019; Sony has held several more events since then.

##  When Is the Next Sony State of Play Event? 

 Sony hasn't announced its next State of Play. The most recent one was May 30, 2024.

##  Which Products Will Be Announced? 

 Sony typically tells us what they'll show when they announce a State of Play, but we don't have the details for the next one yet.

 The last event introduced 14 PS5 and PS VR2 titles from both PlayStation Studios developers and third-party companies.

##  What Did Sony Announce at the Last State of Play? 

 The May 30 State of Play showed off a lot of software to coincide with the start of Sony's Days of Play event. Here's what we saw:

* _Concord_  is the debut title from Firewalk, a developer that Sony recently made part of its PlayStation Studios label. It's an up to five-player, online FPS that puts you in the role of a "freegunner," which is like a galactic mercenary/courier/bounty hunter. It's out August 23, with a public beta in July.

* _God of War: Ragnarok_ came out for PlayStation consoles in November 2022, but it's headed for PC on September 19\. This move is part of Sony's greater initiative to port its first-party titles like_Horizon: Forbidden West_ and_The Last of Us_ .
* _Dynasty Warriors: Origins_ , coming in 2025, puts players in the midst of massive battles. This is the first entry in the series since_Dynasty Warriors 9_ in 2018.
* _Infinity Nikki_ is a dress-up/photography title that may have a darker angle to it.

* _Ballad of Antara_ is a fantasy action-RPG coming in 2025.
* _Skydance's Behemoth_ is a PlayStation VR 2 title from the developers of the acclaimed_Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners_ series. We saw first-person swordplay, along with a huge monster and the main character catching an enemy's arrow in mid-air and then firing it back at them. It's out this fall.
* _Alien: Rogue Incursion_ is out this winter. It's also a PlayStation VR 2 title that has you squaring off against Xenomorphs in 3D (which makes it scarier).
* Marvel is getting into the PvP shooter business with_Marvel Rivals_ , which includes a huge library of characters including Venom, Adam Warlock, Storm, and Spider-Man just_Fortnite_ \-ing it out. It'll be out in July.
* Everstone Studios is working on a_Souls_ \-like called_Where Winds Meet_ .

* We got more details and footage from the PS5 and PC port of the 2015 interactive horror film_Until Dawn_ , which puts you in control of a group of friends trying to survive the night against a variety of dangers. It's coming in the fall of 2024.
* _Path of Exile 2_ is an isometric action game (similar to_Diablo_ ) that includes couch co-op, cross-platform progression, and a really gnarly fantasy world. This one hits early access later this year.
* Developer Bloober Team's_Silent Hill 2_ , a much-anticipated remake of the 2001 classic, showed off more gameplay. The new trailer heavily features Angela, another person whom protagonist James Sunderland meets in the cursed town. We also finally got a release date: October 8, 2024.

* Capcom's_Monster Hunter Wilds_ had its first gameplay trailer. This series has you setting up camp in an untamed world and hunting massive creatures for both fun and profit. The latest entry is coming next year.
* Mascot character Astro Bot, who taught us all how to play our PlayStation 5s in_Astro's Playroom_ , is back for a new adventure in_Astro Bot_ . This platformer will feature new worlds, costumes based on iconic PlayStation characters like Nathan Drake, Kratos, and Aloy, and a huge starship shaped like the PS5 console. It's coming September 6.
