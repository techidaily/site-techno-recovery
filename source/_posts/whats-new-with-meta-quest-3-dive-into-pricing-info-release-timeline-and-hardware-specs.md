##  Meta Quest 3 Features & Specs 

 Quest 3 boasts enhanced visuals through a high-resolution display with 2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye and pancake optics, supported by a next-gen chipset (Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) for superior graphical performance. It introduces[ Meta Reality technology](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/mixed-reality-definition-passthrough-scene-understanding-spatial-anchors/) , which merges the physical and virtual worlds, allowing for natural interactions and immersive experiences.

 The redesigned headset focuses on comfort and control, with a slimmer profile and redesigned Touch Plus controllers. The controllers have a streamlined form and incorporate TruTouch haptics for enhanced feedback. The headset supports tracking so you can interact with virtual elements using just your hands.

 Mark Zuckerberg says the Quest 3 will be compatible with Quest 2's whole library of over 500 games and apps, and more titles will come later.
