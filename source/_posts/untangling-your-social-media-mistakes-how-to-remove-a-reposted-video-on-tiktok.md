##  How to Delete a Repost on TikTok

 Undoing a repost is as easy as posting one. Here's what to do:  

1. Select the video you want to unrepost so that it starts playing.  
 Not sure which video you reposted? See the bottom of this page to learn where all your reposted videos are listed.
2. Tap**Share** (the right arrow).
3. Tap**Remove repost** . You'll see a brief confirmation message.

 You can only delete reposted videos using the TikTok app. There's no option to undo reposts when[ watching TikTok in a web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-tiktok-without-app-5272077) .

##  What Happens When You Unrepost a TikTok?

 Videos you repost are more likely to appear in your followers' feeds. So, when you undo a repost on TikTok, the video will no longer be in their feeds unless they stumble upon it organically.

 Deleting a repost doesn't delete the original video. Only your repost is removed. You won't see how many likes and comments your repost got, but the original video will retain your followers' likes and comments.

##  How Do I Find My Reposted Videos?
