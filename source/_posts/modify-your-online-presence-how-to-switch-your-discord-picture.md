## Why Blur Your Background?

 Blurring your background is useful for a few reasons. It can obscure clutter behind you for a more professional look. Hiding your backdrop can also protect your privacy and others in your household or office. Additionally, it also just looks nice and keeps the focus on your face, not on what’s going on behind you.

 However, if you have an older computer, the blur feature could slow it down as it is resource-heavy. If you find it’s interfering with the quality of the Google Meet call, you can quickly turn it off.

 A lighter-weight solution might be to use a virtual background. Google Meet has many options built-in, and you can also upload images.
