Cons 
* Plans can be expensive

### NordVPN

#### The best VPN for Netflix overall

NordVPN is one of the best Netflix VPNs available.

NordVPN lets you access Netflix from up to 10 devices under a single account and has 111 country options -- one of the largest server networks currently offered by a VPN provider.

During my testing, this VPN never failed to load Netflix, and I tested from the UK to locations including the US, Japan, and Australia. Using some servers to access US content from the UK, for example, often resulted in only Netflix original content and globally licensed TVs and shows being displayed in the library.

Customers say they find the VPN to be consistently reliable and fast, with excellent connections available for US servers.

**Review:** [**NordVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nord-vpn-review-an-in-depth-look-at-a-popular-vpn/)

Prices begin at $3.39/month on a two-year contract, with free eSIM data thrown in. One-year subscriptions start at $4.99/month on a basic plan, whereas month-to-month subscriptions are priced at $12.99\. Available add-ons on higher-tier contracts include browsing protection, anti-malware scanners, ad blocking, and cloud storage.

**NordVPN features:** **Native Streaming Apps:** Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV | **Simultaneous connections:** 10 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries:** 111 | **Servers:** 6,000+ | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Positive customer reviews
* Affordable
* Reasonable server network

Cons 
* Can be slower than competitors

### Surfshark VPN

#### The best affordable VPN for Netflix

Surfshark is a budget-friendly, easy-to-use VPN with a loyal customer base. It isn't always the fastest option, and you can struggle to connect when servers are far from your original location. Overall, however, you can still take advantage of servers in 100 countries. Speed loss isn't always noticeable when streaming, and this VPN offers excellent value for money.

**Review:** [**Surfshark VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

When I used Surfshark to access Netflix, some countries, including Japan, were originally blocked. When I switched to a different server, however, the library was unblocked. I could easily browse Netflix and watch global content, but I had less luck overall accessing geo-restricted content.

Customers say that customer support is excellent, although some have experienced IP blocking issues. 

The cheapest two-year subscription is Surfshark Starter, which costs $2.19 monthly and includes three months of free access. A one-year plan at the basic level costs $3.39/month (with one month free), while one month of VPN service costs $15.45.

****Surfshark VPN features: Native streaming apps:** Fire TV, Android TV, Nvidia Shield TV, Apple TV | **Simultaneous connections:** unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Firefox, Chrome | **Locations:** 100 | **Servers**: 3,200+ | **Logging:** No activity logs | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Excellent speeds
* Quick to connect
* Large server network

Cons 
* No unlimited simultaneous connections
* Expensive

### ExpressVPN

#### The best Netflix VPN for speed

ExpressVPN is another great choice for accessing Netflix. When I tested the service, I found that this VPN provided the best speeds, just ahead of NordVPN. With 105 countries to choose from, you have plenty of options when you're trying to access the service when you're away from home.

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

I did notice that while connected to some servers, my icon changed to red, which may be linked to when Netflix detects a VPN. I also encountered a few blocks to accessing Netflix when I used specific servers, but shifting my connection to another server available in my target country resolved the problem. 

Subscriptions begin at $6.67 per month for a year of VPN service. Alternatively, you can pay $9.99/month for six months or $12.95 for one month. If you pick the annual plan, you will be given three months of free access added to the length of your contract and free Backblaze cloud backup.

Customers say that customer support is top-notch, and the VPN consistently provides unobtrusive, speedy service.

****ExpressVPN features: Native Streaming Apps:** Fire TV, Android TV, Nvidia Shield TV, Apple TV | **Simultaneous Connections:** 8 | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** A lot ([see the full list here](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/troubleshooting/supported-devices/)) | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Countries:** 105 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

Pros 
* Budget-friendly
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* Strong performance

Cons 
* Upload speeds can be slow

### Private Internet Access

#### Best VPN for streaming Netflix over different devices

Private Internet Access is another excellent VPN for streaming, and when it comes to Netflix, this VPN did not disappoint. 

PIA, together with NordVPN, provided the least amount of hassle for access to Netflix. I didn't encounter any blocks during testing. Regarding films and TV shows, I could access some geo-locked content and libraries, but in most cases, I was limited to Netflix originals and globally licensed content. 

This could be your best bet if you just want to access Netflix while you're away from home. PIA offers unlimited simultaneous connections, meaning you can use it on your PC, tablet, smartphone, and other devices at the same time.

**Review:** [**Private Internet Access**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/private-internet-access-review/)

While a month of access will cost you $11.99, if you're willing to sign up for two years, you will only pay the equivalent of $2.19/month. Alternatively, you can opt for a six-month term for $7.50/month.

PIA customer feedback indicates that many users are happy with this VPN, which can be used as a set-and-forget service. 

****Private Internet Access features: Native Streaming Apps:** Android TV, Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV | **Simultaneous Connections:** unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, various browsers | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Countries:** 91 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days

## What is a Netflix VPN service and why should you use one?

A Netflix VPN service is a virtual private network compatible with the Netflix streaming service. Using a VPN to access your streaming services can allow you to watch your local content anywhere, or use a server to change your location via IP address and access other content libraries. This may, however, go against Netflix's licensing agreements.

**See also: [What is a VPN and why do you need one?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-why-do-you-need-one-all-your-virtual-private-network-questions-answered/)**

Netflix [says](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/114701) that if a VPN is detected, the service will only show you content for which the company has global rights. However, during my testing, I found this isn't always the case.

##  How to set up a Netflix VPN 

There are different ways to set up a VPN to work with your Netflix subscription. 

Netflix says that using a VPN [isn't permitted](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/114701) on an ad-supported plan. In addition, the company says that if you use a VPN, Netflix will only make available shows that have been licensed worldwide and won't offer live events. This is, however, assuming that Netflix detects your VPN. In my testing, I found that Netflix sometimes fails to detect when you're using a VPN.

While setting up a VPN for Netflix will differ depending on your preferred service, most of the steps will be the same. First, decide on how you want to install your VPN for Netflix. If you are on a PC, you can visit your VPN's website and download the app directly. For smartphones, you will need to visit Google Play or Apple's App Store. On your TV, Amazon Fire Stick, or Apple TV, you will need to check if a native app is available. 

Once you have downloaded your VPN, sign in using your login credentials, select your preferred country and server, and connect. Visit Netflix and see if you have access. 

During my testing, I found that very few VPNs were blocked outright; it was far more common for libraries to be restricted to globally licensed content when it appeared Netflix wasn't sure of the region. It might make sense for Netflix to adopt this approach rather than locking down libraries outright. However, if you want to watch the content you have a right to and improve your security at the same time, this can be a frustrating limitation.

## How we test VPNs

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been talking about other VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for Netflix below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming Netflix content if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well considering these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming, although we can't guarantee that every VPN will consistently work with Netflix. We also tested access to geo-locked libraries, although we don't suggest you should.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our Netflix VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive apps suitable for various hardware.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days.

## Factors to consider when choosing a Netflix VPN

When you are selecting your new Netflix VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Speed**: There's nothing worse than loading up your favorite Netflix show only to experience lagging or failures to load. Choose a VPN that provides consistently strong speeds and a stable connection.
* **Use cases**: Some VPNs are better than others when accessing streaming services. You must consider what you plan to use the VPN for and what service to use it for.
* **Geo-locking**: Some VPN users might want to access Netflix content in libraries not typically available in their home country. While we don't suggest you do so, if this is your intention, you will need to consider how often the IP addresses used by your VPN are detected and blocked. Customer reviews might be worth reading.
* **Cost**: Cost will be a factor in your decision. You can subscribe to a VPN for as little as a few dollars a month, but if you want a VPN that is reliable in difficult countries -- such as China -- you will likely have to pay more.

## FAQs on Netflix VPNs  

## What's the best free VPN for Netflix?

if you want to test out a VPN for use with Netflix but are not ready to sign up for a paid plan, we would recommend you try out the [free plans](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) offered by [Proton VPN](https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=25&aff%5Fid=4706&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) or [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/upgrade). The free plans are limited, so don't expect your usual speeds. You may also not be able to access the country server you want. However, both free options do have servers in the US. Alternatively, sign up for one of our [top VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) and take advantage of their money-back guarantees, all of which will give you at least 30 days to try them out.

## Does Netflix ban VPN use?

No, but the company can often detect VPN usage by comparing historical data on your typical locations and logins. 

As VPN usage can violate Netflix's licensing agreements, the company appears to try to track down and block the IP addresses used by VPN providers. Therefore, a server that works one day may not work the next. 

## Can I use a VPN to access different Netflix libraries?

Remember that using a VPN to access different Netflix libraries might go against Netflix's terms of service. If you consistently do so, Netflix may track down and block the IP addresses assigned to your VPN, leaving you unable to access content libraries. The reason behind the cat-and-mouse game is that Netflix has licenses to broadcast content in different countries rather than global permission, and you are only entitled to content in your home location.

It's highly unlikely your account will be banned or blocked, but you may lose access to content until you turn your VPN off.

## Is it worth getting a VPN just for Netflix?

Possibly. If the main reason you want a VPN is to access your streaming service while you are away from home, it might be worth paying a few dollars a month for the privilege. VPNs also provide a layer of security that can be important for day-to-day browsing and online activities.

## Do I have to pay for a Netflix VPN?

While there are [trustworthy free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) that don't sell your information, they are backed by paid subscribers and will simply reduce the server range, number, and speed on offer. So, they aren't often the best option for streaming services such as Netflix. 

To use a VPN that won't drastically reduce your Netflix speeds, you will need a Netflix subscription and a basic, paid VPN plan.

## How do I tell if my VPN is safe?

First, choose a reputable VPN vendor with a strong security background. Then, to check that your VPN is working properly, compare your IP address before and after enabling a VPN connection. You can find this in your device's settings or by visiting [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). 

If you see the same IP address, your VPN is probably not working properly, as a VPN should assign you a new IP address. You can also visit [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to see if any DNS leaks have been detected while using a VPN, which could be a sign that your information is being leaked. 

If you find that some websites can't be accessed while you're using a VPN, don't fret. Some websites will detect and block IP addresses used by the VPN provider. It may not signal anything dangerous, so just try connecting to a different server.

You should also be careful with free VPNs, especially if they are outside of official app repositories or relatively unknown companies. Free is rarely free, and while there are a handful of trustworthy VPN options, many will sell your information.

## Are there alternative Netflix VPNs to consider?

It can be a cat-and-mouse game between streaming services and VPNs, and so, maybe none of the above options are the best fit for you. If so, consider other noteworthy VPNs for Netflix below:

[Best free alternative Proton VPN Proton VPN provides a trustworthy free option. While limited, it can still be used to access your Netflix library.
