## How Do I Turn Off Subtitles on Amazon Prime?

 When you turn on subtitles on Amazon Prime, the feature will stay on until you turn it off. If you’re in a different environment and no longer require subtitles, turning the feature off works a lot like turning it on. You need to play a video with subtitles enabled, and switch off the feature using the Closed Caption and Subtitles menu.

 Here’s how to turn off Subtitles on Amazon Prime on the web player:

1. Play a video that has subtitles turned on, and click the**Closed Caption or Subtitles (speech bubble)** icon.

## How Do I Permanently Turn Off Subtitles?

 You may find subtitles are on automatically even though you don’t want subtitles. You can turn off subtitles while watching a video, but that may not permanently turn off subtitles. Subtitles and closed captions are supposed to remain off when you turn them off, but a bug can sometimes cause subtitles to turn back on.
  
 Before you do anything else, check other video apps. If subtitles are also on in your other apps, you need to turn subtitles off on your device. There may be a CC button on your remote, or you may need to disable subtitles in the device settings. Look for a subtitles, closed captions, or accessibility settings menu in the device settings.

 If your Amazon subtitles won’t turn off permanently, try these this procedure:

1. Turn off subtitles using the method described above.
2. Log out of the Amazon website, or uninstall the Amazon app.
3. Log back into the Amazon website, or reinstall the Amazon app.
4. If subtitles are on, turn them off using the method described above.
5. Play a different video, and check to see if subtitles are off.
6. If subtitles are still on, contact Amazon for further support.
