##  What Does Netflix Code NW-1-19 Mean? 

 If you're receiving the Netflix error code NW1-19, that usually means you've lost your internet connection. Without an internet connection, Netflix cannot stream the television show or movie you want to watch.

 However, it's also possible that your internet provider doesn't allow streaming, which could be a common problem if you're using a public internet connection. Be sure you're allowed to use your connection for streaming before trying any of the other troubleshooting steps below. If not, switching to a network where streaming is allowed should restore it.

##  Why Is Netflix Saying No Internet Connection? 

 Your connection to the internet has been lost. If you're on a network where streaming is allowed, it could be because there is a service outage with your internet provider or because you're having hardware issues. It may even be something as simple as a software glitch that's keeping your Netflix app from connecting.

 Regardless of the culprit, there are a few things you can try to get your streaming device reconnected so you can reaccess Netflix.

##  How Do I Reset My Internet Connection on Netflix? 

 If you've received Netflix error code NW-1-19, it's because you're not connected to the internet. Here are some things that might get you reconnected so you can get back to watching your Netflix choices.

1. Check your internet connection. The easiest way to do this is to use another internet-connected device. If that device can connect to your network, then your internet service is OK. If that device cannot link to your service, then you may want to use a mobile network to check your provider's website for information about outages.  
 If the internet is out in your area, you can[ troubleshoot the problem](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) or wait until your provider restores the service and then try Netflix again.
2. Turn off your VPN. If you're using a virtual private network (VPN), it could be interfering with your connection to the internet. Try disabling the VPN and then reaccessing Netflix, as that might fix your problem.
3. Restart your streaming device. There may be a glitch with your streaming device, especially if it's lost its internet connection and then encountered an error while restarting. It can happen when power to the streaming device cuts abruptly (like in a storm) or if it was shut down improperly.  
 In most streaming devices (Like the Apple TV), there's an option in**Settings** to**Restart** the device. On some devices, like the Roku, you can use the accompanying remote to start the device. For example, on the Roku remote, press the**Home** button five times, press the**Up** arrow,**Rewind** , and**Fast Forward** . That should restart the device.  
 If your device doesn't have that option, the manufacturer's website should have information that tells you how to restart the device correctly.
4. [ Restart your modem or router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . If restarting your streaming device doesn't work, try restarting your home network. That usually entails removing the power from your home networking equipment, waiting for 30-60 seconds, and then plugging everything back in.  
 Once everything is powered back on and connected again, try Netflix on this new connection.
5. Connect your streaming device directly to your modem. If your streaming device has trouble connecting wirelessly to your internet network, try plugging it directly into the modem using an ethernet cable. Doing this should improve your connection so you can log back into Netflix without encountering any errors.
6. Restore default internet settings. Your default internet settings are specific to your internet service provider. If you've changed any of those settings, then you'll need to[ reaccess your modem settings](https://www.lifewire.com/access-modem-settings-5185705) to restore them to the default settings your service provider uses. You may be able to find those settings in the help section of your service provider's website, or you may need to call them to find out what settings you should be using.
