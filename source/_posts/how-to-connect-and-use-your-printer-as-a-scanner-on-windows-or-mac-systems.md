## How to Open iPhone SIM Card Tray With a Paper Clip

 A paper clip is one of the easiest and most common objects to use when you don't have an ejector tool.

1. Start with a small or medium-size paper clip.
2. Unfold one straight side, so it's sticking out.

3. Stick the straight side of the paper clip into the SIM card ejector hole as far as it will go.

4. With the paper clip in the hole, use your thumb to press firmly until the tray protrudes. It should slide out slowly rather than pop out.

## Finding the iPhone SIM Card Ejector Tool

 The SIM card tool for ejecting the tray from the side of the iPhone comes in the box as long as your country and network-specific iPhone include it.

 In the U.S., iPhones include documentation, such as legal notices and getting-started guides. The SIM ejector tool may be hidden in these papers. It's a small piece of metal attached to a white piece of paper; this makes it easy to throw out accidentally.

 If you can't find the tool or bought an iPhone secondhand, there are other ways to open the SIM tray to add or replace a SIM card.

## Try These Items to Eject a SIM Tray

 The opening used to eject a SIM card tray is tiny. Although plenty of straight objects might work, the SIM hole requires something sturdy with a narrow dimension.

 Watch your thumb when pushing any of these tools you may have around the house into your phone. Most of them are sharp and could pierce the skin.

 Here are some ideas that have worked:

* **Paper clip** : Most small and average size paper clips work by bending one side. If you don't have a SIM removal tool, a paper clip works well.
* **Safety pin** : Not all sizes of safety pins work. Find the smallest safety pin possible to fit inside the hole.
* **Earring** : An earring works in a pinch. Take off the earring back and insert the post into the SIM tray hole. Be careful because soft materials such as gold bend easily.
* **Staple** : A standard staple can come through in a pinch, but it may be hard to use because it is thin and flexible. A thicker, industrial staple is a better choice.
* **Mechanical pencil** : To use a mechanical pencil, give it a few clicks to extend it farther than you would to write. Poke the point in the hole and give it a firm push. It's challenging to use because of how brittle the lead is, but it's a common item found around the house or in a backpack.
* **Toothpick** : Most toothpicks are a little too wide for the iPhone SIM hole. Whittle away some of the wood to make it fit and break off the tip.
* **Fishing hook** : Fishing hooks come in various shapes and sizes, so if you're off on a boat and need an emergency SIM swap, try one of these.

 Many cellphone carrier stores have extra SIM card ejector tools if you'd prefer to stay with a proven and guaranteed method of extraction.

## iPhone Models and SIM Tray Locations

 The SIM tray, a narrow oval with a tiny circle beneath it, is on the phone's right side on most iPhones and sits flush with the side of the phone and isn't visible if you're using a phone case. On the earliest models, it's on the bottom edge of the phone.

 The iPhone XS Max was the first iPhone to switch the SIM card's direction rested on the SIM tray. Instead of sitting in the tray facing you, the SIM card sits on the backside of the tray.
