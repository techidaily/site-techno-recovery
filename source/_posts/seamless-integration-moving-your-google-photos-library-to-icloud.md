###  What to Know

* First, you need to export your Google Photos files. There's no way to copy Google Photos to iCloud directly.
* Google Takeout is the best way to download everything at once. You can also save individual items only.
* To move Google Photos to iCloud, visit**iCloud.com/photos** and upload the photos and videos you saved.

 This article explains how to export your photos from Google Photos and then import them directly into iCloud.

##  Is There a Way to Transfer Google Photos to iCloud?

 The short answer is yes, but not directly. There's no simple transfer button to magically move everything over to iCloud from Google Photos. Your only option is to download the files you want to import to iCloud and then upload them to your account. Below are all the directions you need to get this done.

##  How to Download From Google Photos

 Currently, the only way to move your Google Photos over is to download them to your computer and then upload them to iCloud. There are three ways to do this, depending on how many items you want to copy over.

###  Download Everything at Once

[ Google Takeout](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-takeout-4173795) is a free tool from Google built specifically for this purpose. Here's how to download all your Google Photos data to prepare for the transfer:

1. [ Open the Google Takeout website](https://takeout.google.com/) and log in with your Google account if asked.
2. To export just your photos and videos, click**Deselect all** .

3. Scroll down and check**Google Photos** .

 Select**All photo albums included** to change what Google Takeout should download. Saving everything from your account could take a while and might be excessive if you really just want to transfer specific albums to iCloud.
