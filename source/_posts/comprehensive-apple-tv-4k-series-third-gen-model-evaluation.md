## [Best Overall: Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)

![The Malwarebytes main dashboard screen.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vTzVer27rTDeOXDiqlwB73IV-IM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/main-764935658967489280c7bdd89a016074.JPG)

 What We Like

* Great independent testing scores.
* Easy to use.
* Available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks real-time scanning.
* Includes few extra features.

 Thanks to its sterling reputation, frequent updates, and ease of use, Malwarebytes is our top pick for the best free malware removal tool. The no-cost version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware even comes with a free trial of the premium version, which protects you with real-time scanning and additional measures to thwart ransomware.

 Malwarebytes is a comprehensive security tool designed to shore up your traditional antivirus program. It receives daily updates to help you keep on top of the latest malware and employs several techniques to help it identify brand-new malware on your system that’s never been seen before. Once Malwarebytes has identified an issue, it can clean up and remove the malicious code.

 This fantastic malware removal tool is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Chromebooks. The free version lets you scan for malware and remove it whenever you want, but it lacks the real-time scanning and protection you get from the premium version.

## [Best for Windows: Malicious Software Removal Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=9905)

![A screenshot of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT).](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/iIm1KtvGkNWhS1WCjN1V3BruM-I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/MSRTScan-a7095e68a97a417f96fb719d93d1e11f.jpg)

 What We Like

* Designed for Windows.
* Requires no registration.
* Runs automatically with Windows updates.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited malware targeting.
* Single-use program.

 There are a lot of excellent malware removal tools for Windows, but the one you can’t do without is Microsoft’s Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT). Thanks to[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) , this indispensable free malware cleanup tool might already be on your computer. If you're not sure, download it manually below.

 Microsoft updates the Malicious Software Removal Tool regularly, and a new version, designed to remove new malware threats, is usually available once per month. It isn’t updated as often as other tools but targets the most prevalent malware threats, so it should be your first line of defense as a Windows user.

 MSRT isn’t designed to replace your antivirus software, and it works best when used in conjunction with a good antivirus and other anti-malware apps. It’s been available since Windows XP, but Microsoft only provides support and updates for the latest editions of the OS, like Windows 11.

[Download MSRT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=9905)

 If your Windows computer is infected to the point that it won't let you log in, Microsoft has a[virus scanner that runs before the PC starts](https://www.lifewire.com/free-bootable-antivirus-tools-2625785) .

## [Best Antivirus With Malware Removal: Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)

![A screenshot of Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition working on a desktop.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UAnaf9PFeWkbSArNBKuq9ezHAHM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/bitdefender-scanning-28e74335997d4f0eb0b52673b8f5a864.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Available for Windows, macOS, and Android.
* Excellent independent testing scores.
* Great for older computers.

 What We Don't Like

* No automatic (software) updates, but virus definitions do auto-update.

 Bitdefender is our pick for the best antivirus that includes built-in malware protection. You can use it as your primary defense against viruses, worms, trojans, zero-day exploits, rootkits, and malware.

 The free version of Bitdefender is lightweight and easy to use but lacks some of the advanced features you get with the premium versions, like automatic updates. It's equipped with the basic features required to protect your computer with real-time threat detection, virus scanning, and malware removal.

 In addition to real-time threat detection, Bitdefender has a handy option allowing you to drag and drop suspicious files or folders to the app’s home screen. This is a straightforward way to quickly scan any files you suspect may be infected.

[14 Best Free Spyware Removal Tools (2024)](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-spyware-removal-4151293)

 Our top pick for the best malware removal tool capable of tackling spyware is SUPERAntiSpyware. This program specializes in spyware, but it can also handle a variety of other threats, including rootkits and ransomware.

 SUPERAntiSpyware is designed to work with your antivirus, specifically targeting spyware, adware, keyloggers, and other threats to your data. It can also protect your files against ransomware, which is especially nefarious software designed to hijack your data unless you pay the attacker to release it.

 The free version of SUPERAntiSpyware comes with the same daily updates as the paid version, ensuring you’re always protected against the latest threats. The only catch is that you have to check for updates automatically.

 SUPERAntiSpyware is only available for Windows but is compatible with every operating system version dating back to Windows 7\. That makes it a great way to protect your computer if you’re still using an outdated version of Windows.

Gen Digital Inc.

 What We Like

* Includes antivirus and malware protection.
* Protects email and hardens Wi-Fi network.
* Excellent independent testing scores.

 What We Don't Like

* No ransomware protection.
* No real-time Wi-Fi intrusion protection.

 Avast Security is our top pick for the best free Mac malware removal tool due to its fantastic track record of detecting and eliminating various types of malware. In independent testing, it was able to root out 99.9 percent of macOS malware, giving it the edge over other free options.

 macOS has a reputation for not being as vulnerable to viruses and malware as Windows, but it’s still essential to protect your data against a worst-case scenario. Avast Security is the best free option out there, combining an excellent antivirus platform with top-of-the-line malware detection and protection against email and web infections. It can even harden your Wi-Fi network against intrusion.

 The free version of Avast for macOS provides most of the benefits you get from the paid version, but it can’t protect your data against ransomware or identify Wi-Fi intrusions in real time. If you want those features, you’ll need the paid version.
