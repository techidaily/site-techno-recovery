## Is SnappyDriver v1.13 Worth Your Time? Detailed Review Inside
 Snappy Driver Installer (SDI) is a powerful[free driver updater tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-driver-updater-tools-2619206) for Windows that can store its entire collection of[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) offline. This allows the program to access fast driver updates, even if it can't find an active internet connection.

 This review is of Snappy Driver Installer version 1.13.2.766, released on July 1, 2024\. Please[let us know](https://www.lifewire.com/mailto:feedback@lifewire.com) if there's a newer version I need to review.

## Snappy Driver Installer Pros & Cons

 I've used this software off and on many times, and I can't find much to dislike about it.

 What We Like

* Downloads drivers directly through the program so you don't need to use a web browser.
* Can download drivers for use offline.
* Supports bulk driver downloads and installs.
* Downloads at full, unrestricted speeds.
* No limit to the number of downloads and updates you can perform.
* Completely free from advertisements.
* Will optionally create a Restore Point before driver installs.
* It's portable, so it doesn't need to be installed.

 What We Don't Like

* It's a little confusing to use.
* Can't create a schedule that checks for updates.

## More About Snappy Driver Installer

* Snappy Driver works with both[32-bit and 64-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) versions of Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP
* Drivers are downloaded through Snappy Driver Installer in what are called_driverpacks_ , which are just collections (packs) of drivers for various hardware like sound devices,[video cards](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) , etc.
* Options off to the side of Snappy Driver Installer (in_Expert mode_ ) let you filter the results to show drivers that aren't installed but need to be, drivers that are newer than what is installed, and display current or older drivers only
* You can use Snappy Driver Installer to locate and open the INF file for installed drivers
* Updates that require you to restart your computer are called out as such so that it's easy to distinguish them from the rest; restarts don't happen automatically so that all the drivers have a chance to install
* Snappy Driver Installer can also show duplicate drivers and invalid drivers
* Information for drivers can be seen like the manufacturer and HardwareID as well as the installed driver's and available driver's date and[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043)

## My Thoughts on Snappy Driver Installer

 This is a nice program for not only finding which of your devices require a driver update but also finding the specific, proper driver that devices need,_as well as_ actually installing the driver for you.

 Unfortunately, Snappy Driver Installer isn't nearly as easy to use as similar programs like[Driver Booster](https://www.lifewire.com/driver-booster-review-2619190) , but it's still pretty self-explanatory. After having the program download the driver updates your computer needs, you can use the side menu to select and install all of them.

 Something I should mention again is how Snappy Driver Installer can be used for offline driver updates. I love this feature because it means I can download_lots_ of drivers for many different devices at once, but not install any of them on my computer. I can then load those drivers into Snappy Driver Installer on any computer, even if it doesn't have a network connection.

[Download Snappy Driver Installer](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin/)

 This download includes a few[EXE](https://www.lifewire.com/exe-file-2622732) files. One is called_SDIO\_x64_ and is for[64-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) versions of Windows. See[How to Tell if You Have Windows 64-Bit or 32-Bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you need help choosing the right one.
