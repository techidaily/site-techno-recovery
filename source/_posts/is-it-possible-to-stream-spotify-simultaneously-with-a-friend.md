## Is It Possible to Stream Spotify Simultaneously with a Friend?

Close 

###  What to Know

* To start a Jam: Tap**Connect** button from**Now Playing** bar >**Start a Jam** \>**Send Link** .
* Up to 32 people can listen to Spotify simultaneously using Jam.
* Jam hosting is a Premium feature, but free members can join Jam sessions.

 Sharing your favorite song on Spotify with someone is always nice. But can two people listen to Spotify at the same time? Yes, you can listen together in real time using Spotify Jam, which doesn't require you to buy a Spotify Family Plan or be in the same place.

##  Can I Listen to Spotify with a Friend at the Same Time? 

 Yes, two people can listen to Spotify simultaneously, thanks to the[ Spotify Jam (formerly Group Session)](https://www.lifewire.com/listen-to-spotify-with-friends-5120356) feature. 

 If you want to add more friends to your listening party, groups of up to 32 people can start listening to a song or a playlist on one device or their own devices via Jam.

 Here's how to start and share a Jam with a friend:  

1. Open Spotify and start playing a song, a playlist, or a podcast.
2. Tap the**Connect** icon from the Now Playing bar.
3. Select the**Start a Jam** .  
![Steps to Start a Jam from the Now Playing bar and Start a Jam screen in the Spotify mobile app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oAInPGB_FifZBfIT894umzMdx04=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_have-two-people-listen-to-spotify-at-same-time-5205195-4da12d7bffd84b6e8fa6a593942bcd27.jpg)
4. Select**Share link** to send a link in a messaging app or through email.  
 Tap**Scan QR Code** to share with friends who are nearby. You can also both tap your phones together to share the Jam—as long as your friend is also logged in to Spotify and is connected to Bluetooth.
5. To exit the Jam, tap**End** if you are the host. As a guest, select**Leave** to remove yourself from a friend's Jam.  
 If the host leaves a Jam, the session automatically ends for everyone else.  
![Spotify Jam share options and the End session button in the mobile app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-oB93QTM85kEs1sqcTdC06ca8NY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_have-two-people-listen-to-spotify-at-same-time-5205195-9f1f784547b745a8b2974b02945b0a7a.jpg)

 While listening to Spotify simultaneously, both host and guests can control the song or the playlist, unless the host changes this setting. It works just like any individual session:

* Host and guests can pause, play, skip, and select tracks to listen together.
* Anyone can also add songs to the queue in the usual way.
* Any change will show up on all grouped devices in real-time.

 If you want to limit guests to adding tracks only, select the**gear** icon at the top of the Jam page > deselect**Let others change what's playing** .

##  Do You Need Spotify Premium to Share Your Account With Another Person? 

 Yes, hosting a Spotify Jam Group is a Premium-only feature. However, both Spotify Premium and Spotify Free members can be a part of the session and control the playback. Participants can join on the mobile, tablet, and desktop apps.  

 Spotify's**Blend** is a neat way to[ sync your music tastes with a friend](https://www.lifewire.com/why-you-should-try-spotify-blend-5192254) . Blend is a shared playlist that combines your music tastes with a friend's, thus helping each other match and mix listening experiences. Combine this automatic playlist with a Jam to bond over music.
