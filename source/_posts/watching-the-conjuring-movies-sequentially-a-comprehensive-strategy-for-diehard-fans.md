##  How to Watch the ‘Conjuring’ Movies in Chronological Order 

 The original 2013 film and its direct sequels are set during the 1970s and into the early 80s. The movies follow the fictional ghost hunting of real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren.

 However, the series has also produced several spinoffs that delve into the backstories of other characters, including the infamous haunted doll Annabelle. This has resulted in a timeline that spans about 30 years (1952 - 1981).

 If a movie isn't available on a subscription streaming platform, you can rent or buy them from platforms like Amazon, Apple TV, and Google Play. You may even get a good deal on a bundle that includes several (or even all) of the movies.
