If you use Google Maps on your smartwatch, there's a useful new feature you need to know about.

Thanks to a recent update, you can use Google Maps navigation even if your watch doesn't have an internet connection and it's not connected to a phone with an internet connection.

When Google unveiled the [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-3-key-specs-features-price-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know/), it detailed a feature that would let you save maps for offline use on your watch. That feature now appears to be rolling out to all [WearOS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-ways-to-get-more-out-of-your-wearos-smartwatch/) devices.

"Offline maps on the phone are auto-downloaded to the watch," the updated WearOS version of the Maps app explains when you open it. There's also an "Offline maps" section in the settings.

Here's how the feature works: Data for your home area is automatically downloaded on your smartwatch when you open and use the app (Google didn't specify what constitutes your "home" area). The app also will sync any offline map data from your connected phone. Any offline map files saved on your smartphone will automatically sync with your WearOS smartwatch when it's charging with a Wi-Fi connection.

You'll see a slashed cloud icon that lets you know when you're in offline Maps view.

Since storage space is limited on smartwatches, you have the option to delete any maps you don't want.

The feature appears to be available [on some Samsung watches](https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watches-google-maps-offline-wear-os/), including the [Galaxy Watch 4](https://www.zdnet.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic/) from 2021 and the [Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-smartwatches-but-im-wearing-the-galaxy-ultra-watch-long-term/), and it was available on my [Pixel Watch 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-review/). Don't see the feature on your device yet? It does seem to be rolling out to a wide variety of devices, even older ones, so you should see it soon. You'll know you have the update when you get the message about offline map availability.
