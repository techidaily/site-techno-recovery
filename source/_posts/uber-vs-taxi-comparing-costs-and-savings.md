 What We Like

* Ideal if who want to journal without writing.

 What We Don't Like

* No traditional writing options for wordier entries.

 The layout is clean and easy to use, with attractive icons for recording daily updates about your activities and moods. You can customize the look by choosing different colors and also add text to entries if you'd like to include some written details—though more traditional journaling isn't supported.
