## What is the Apple Studio Display?

The Studio Display is just that: a display. It features a built-in camera array and only functions as an external monitor for the MacBook, Mac Mini, Mac Pro, Mac Studio, and iPad Air (5th generation) and Pro (3rd generation or later) models running iPadOS 15.4 or later. That puts it alongside the older Pro Display XDR within Apple's standalone monitor lineup.

## What does Apple Studio Display look like?

On the hardware front, the Studio Display looks a lot like last year's [24-inch iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac-24/) with thin bezels and a cool-to-the-touch, aluminum design. The default tilt-adjustable stand keeps the display afloat and allows for up to 30 degrees of tilt movement. The display can also rotate in landscape and portrait orientations when paired with the optional VESA mount adapter.

At the top of the Studio Display sits a 12MP Ultra Wide camera, capable of Center Stage. That's Apple's smart camera feature that continuously pans, zooms, and focuses on you as you move around. 

There's also a three-mic array for greater voice detection and noise cancellation. Flanking the sides of the monitor are six high-fidelity speakers, four of which are force-cancelling woofers. Together, the speaker system can take advantage of Apple's Spatial Audio playback and Dolby Atmos. 

Behind the Studio Display are three USB-C ports and one Thunderbolt port that is capable of 96W charging when connected to a MacBook.
