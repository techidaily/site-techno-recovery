 Apple updates macOS, the operating system that runs its desktop and laptop computers, every fall. Here's what you need to know about macOS 15, which is called Sequoia.

## macOS 15 (Sequoia) Release Date

 Apple debuted macOS Sequoia at the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 10, with a release date in Fall 2024.

## macOS 15 (Sequoia) Price

 Like with all of Apple's operating system updates, macOS Sequoia will be free.

## Pre-Order Information

 You can't pre-order macOS Sequoia, but you can sign up for the public beta to try out new features. You can sign up at[Apple's beta site](https://beta.apple.com) .

## macOS 15 (Sequoia) Features

 This version of macOS includes updates to almost all of Apple's stock apps, along with a new, AI-focused interface. Here's a quick rundown of some of the new features:

**Calculator** : The biggest update to the Calculator app, possibly ever, shows your calculations and expressions as you enter them, keeps track of your history, and automatically converts units.

**Continuity** : We're used to[Handoff](https://www.lifewire.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handoff-4079966) , which lets us seamlessly keep working on apps between our iPhone and Mac, but macOS Sequoia kicks it up a bit by letting you completely run your iPhone from your Mac.

 Your iPhone will appear on your Mac's screen, and you can control everything, including apps and Facetime calls without picking up the device.

 Along with the mirroring, you'll also be able to drag apps between your iPhone and Mac and receive app notifications on your Mac.
