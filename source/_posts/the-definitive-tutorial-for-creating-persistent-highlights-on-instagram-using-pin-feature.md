##  What Else Do I Need To Know about Instagram Pinned Chats? 

 ‌Pinning messages to the top of your Instagram inbox is very useful if you have many chats to juggle. It means no need to dig around for important threads. However, you should consider these limitations before using the feature:  

* **You can pin up to three chats** . It’s possible to pin three chats to the top of your inbox; that includes both[ group chats](https://www.lifewire.com/make-instagram-group-chat-5704891) as well as individual ones.
* **Pinned chats appear in order of pinning.** Rather than going chronologically, once you pin more than one chat, the messages appear according to when you pinned them.
* **Only personal accounts can pin.** If you’re running a business Instagram account, you can’t pin chats to the top of your inbox. The feature is only available for personal Instagram accounts.
* **Notifications remain the same.** If you have push notifications set up, you’ll receive the same notifications for pinned messages as you would with any other message. They’re not prioritized.
