## Discover the History and Impact of Netflix's Former DVD Rental Program
### Note

 Netflix ended its DVD rental service on September 29, 2023\. See[Netflix's FAQ](https://dvd.netflix.com/Faq) for more information. This article remains for archival purposes.

 Netflix used to have two separate services: an online streaming platform you access through[www.netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) and other apps, and also a DVD rental program via dvd.netflix.com, where they sent you DVDs through the mail.

 Netflix's DVD program included some TV shows and movies that weren't available through[their streaming service](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) . You could watch both DVDs and Blu-rays, and there were a few plans to pick from depending on how many discs you wanted to borrow at once.

## Netflix's DVD Plans

 There are three DVD Netflix plans. All of them offer unlimited discs per month, no late fees, free shipping and returns, DVDs and Blu-rays, and no long-term commitment (just month-by-month).

 The only difference between these plans is the number of discs you can have at once:

* **Basic** : $9.99 /month; one disc at a time
* **Standard** : $14.99 /month; two discs at a time
* **Premium** : $19.99 /month; three discs at a time

## How to Sign Up for DVD Netflix

 These directions are for using a desktop web browser, but you can also sign up with the DVD Netflix mobile app.

## How to Choose DVDs

 Netflix automatically sends DVDs to you based on what you've added to your personal queue. The order in which you receive them is based on the way they're arranged within the queue.

 Once you've returned the DVD, the next title on the list is sent, and so on.

 Here's how to add movies to your DVD Netflix queue and then adjust which ones you'll get first:

### From a Computer

1. From DVD Netflix, select**Add to Queue** or**Add** , depending on the screen you're looking at, next to any DVD you want.  
![DVD Netflix Add to Queue button](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3_4_AW0IsPIrCM861X44RVIPLxc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dvd-netflix-add-to-queue-d48f9e0f986242f98683ce1ee0581732.png)  
 To add a whole season of a TV show, pick the season you want to rent and choose**Add All to Queue** .

 You can find titles by searching by name, people, or genre. There's also a**Browse** menu for locating popular movies, new releases, and Netflix's top 100 titles.
2. Open your queue via the**QUEUE** menu at the top of the site to manage the DVDs. You can adjust the order by dragging the titles up and down. Delete an item by hovering your mouse over it and selecting the trash icon.

## How to Return Netflix DVDs

 You have to return DVDs to Netflix in order to get the next one from your queue.

 Returning your rented DVDs to Netflix is easy. Just put the disc into the sleeve and envelope that came with it when you received it, and then put it in your mailbox or drop it off at a local post office.

## How to Cancel DVD Netflix

 You can leave the DVD Netflix program at any time to stop getting DVDs from Netflix.

 If you have a streaming plan with Netflix, ending your DVD plan will**not** affect it.

1. Log in to Netflix at[netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com/) or with the Netflix or DVD Netflix mobile app.
2. Hover your mouse over the profile image at the top right of the screen, and then choose**Account** . If you're using the app, go to**More** \>**Account** to open your account information in your browser.
