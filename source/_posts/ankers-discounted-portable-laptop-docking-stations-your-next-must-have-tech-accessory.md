## Anker's Discounted Portable Laptop Docking Stations: Your Next Must-Have Tech Accessory!

Don't have a laptop docking station? Don't miss out anymore, and pick up one from Anker now.

 Laptop docking stations are, honestly, pretty cool. They sort of seem like something you don't need, but if you're looking to do anything productive on your laptop, they can be a lifesaver. A good docking station provides extra ports, so you hook your laptop up to monitors and peripherals that can make working a lot more comfortable. The [best laptop docking stations](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-apple-iphone-13-mini-to-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) take it a step further by also keeping your laptop charged or other helpful little extras. In short, once you have a docking station, you won't want to go without again.

 If you're looking to get yourself a docking station, or upgrading an old one, you're in luck. Anker currently has a wide selection of docking stations on sale at both Amazon and the company's store page. This company is well-known for its quality but budget-priced charging accessories, and these docks are no exception.

 The star of this sale is the [Anker 675 USB-C Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Wireless-Charging-ThinkPad/dp/B0BNZ4D72B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002600&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-docking-station-sale%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). This dock is our pick for the best laptop dock for [MacBooks](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-xiaomi-civi-3-phones-by-drfone-android/), but it'll work great with [Windows laptops](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-blueprint-for-designing-eye-catching-thumbnails-for-your-youtube-channel/), as well. With the 675, you'll get a docking station that doubles as a monitor or laptop stand, which will let you sit more comfortably while working (instead of hunched over trying to read a screen). It also comes with a wireless charging pad built in, so you can easily charge your smartphone, and the dock's design allows you to slip small items you're not using under it, keeping your workstation tidy.

 You can save $30 on this dock now, bringing the total down to $169.99\. If you're buying it from [Anker's site](https://www.anker.com/products/a8377?variant=42385499914390&irclickid=079VkJWvXxyPTDSXNSzLoXqMUkHRsFwBRyBaxY0&irgwc=1&utm%5Fsource=impact&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&partner=156932), make sure the code **WSPE5GMRIF** applies at checkout!
