Google just unveiled its [Pixel Watch 3](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-hazel-band-lte-matte-hazel%2F6588315.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and the new version is poised to correct some of the drawbacks of [its predecessor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-review/). The third version of the Pixel Watch will come in two sizes: a 41mm and 45mm version, each sporting smaller bezels and UWB support, with the larger model outfitted with a higher capacity battery.

## What is the Google Pixel Watch?

Released in the US in October 2022, the [first iteration of the Pixel Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-review/) offered a rounded AMOLED display, a simple interface, and Fitbit integration. This initial version received some dings for its poor battery life and uncertain durability. Launched a year later in October 2023, [the Pixel Watch 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-review/) fixed some of the limitations of its predecessor, but still came in only one size. Google's latest version, the [Pixel Watch 3](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-hazel-band-lte-matte-hazel%2F6588315.p), launches with two sizes, a larger display, and a larger battery. 

## What are some of the key features of the Pixel Watch 3?

There are a handful of new features in the Google Pixel Watch 3\. Let's look at some of the most noteworthy:

**Big display upgrade:** Google's Actua display on the Pixel Watch 3 improves on the previous model as it's brighter and more power-efficient (up to a maximum of 2,000 nits) and has an upgraded 60Hz refresh rate, twice as fast as last year's watch. That refresh rate upgrade alone goes a long way to making the watch's display look and feel more premium, with much smoother graphics.

**Loss of pulse detection:** The Pixel Watch 3 comes with an incredibly useful feature that springs into action if it detects loss of a heartbeat on its wearer. In the event of a heart attack, stroke, or other event that results in loss of pulse, the watch will send an alert to the user. If the user doesn't respond, the watch will automatically notify first responders of the wearer's location.

**Morning Brief:** The new Pixel Watch 3 takes your health data and translates it into an narrative summary every morning to help the wearer get a clear picture of their day. It summarizes key health metrics like sleep quality, cardio load (a new metric), and other data from the previous day to inform the wearer's recovery status. 

**App integrations:** The Pixel Watch 3 plays nicely with the Google ecosystem, improving on a handful of integrations with other apps such as Google Nest, where you can see a live feed at your doorbell, or Google TV, where the watch can act as a remote control. The watch can also pair with the Google Pixel phone's camera to frame and take shots while the phone is not in-hand. 

## When will the Pixel Watch 3 launch?

The Pixel Watch 3 was unveiled on August 13, 2024 at the [Made by Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-announced-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) event, and is available now for pre-order on [Google's store](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5F9), as well as retailers like [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-hazel-band-lte-matte-hazel%2F6588315.p), with additional retailers coming soon. Orders are expected to ship during the first weeks of September 2024\.

## What improvements will the Pixel Watch 3 offer over the Pixel Watch 2?

**Size** \- The first improvement on the list is the available sizes. While the original Pixel and the Pixel 2 watches came in just a 41mm size, the Pixel Watch 3 offers [two models to choose from](https://www.zdnet.com/article/pixel-watch-3-could-fix-our-biggest-gripe-with-googles-wearable/) \-- the regular 41mm option and a larger 45mm flavor. Both versions will come in cellular and Wi-Fi variants. 

**Battery** \- The larger size brings a bigger battery. The capacity for the 41mm version remains 306mAh, while the 45mm edition is equipped with a 420mAh battery that promises to last longer without the need for a recharge. Otherwise, both watches will be powered by the [Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/Snapdragon-W5+W5-Gen1-platform-product-brief.pdf) with a custom co-processor.

**Bezels** \- The Pixel Watch 2 was designed with a relatively huge 5.5mm bezel size, prompting some owners to gripe about having such a large frame around the screen. Both versions of the Pixel Watch 3 slim down to 4.5mm bezels, giving you a bit more screen real estate.

**Also: [I went hands-on with Google Pixel Watch 3: These three best features make a difference](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-google-pixel-watch-3-these-three-best-features-make-a-difference/)**

**Display** \- The display on the third version is twice as bright, with both models sporting a 2,000-nit display. The brighter screen should be easier on the eyes, especially in direct sunlight and similar conditions, as it can still be adjusted down to as dim as 1 nit of brightness in dark conditions. 

**Colors** \- No smartwatch would be complete without a choice of colors. The Pixel Watch 3 is offered in a handful of colorways, including a Matte Black case with Obsidian band and a Polished Silver case with a Porcelain band. The 41mm variant comes in a Silver case with a Rose Quartz band and a Gold case with a Hazel band, as well as a Hazel case with a Hazel band.

**Price** \- Though the Pixel Watch 3 sounds cool with its larger size and better battery, that also translates to a larger price point. The [41mm version starts at $349](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3), while the [45mm starts at $399](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3). 

**UWB** \- Last, but by no means least, is UWB, or [ultra-wideband](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-uwb-and-why-you-really-need-an-iphone-to-use-it/). A low-energy, short-range radio technology used for certain types of connectivity and communications, UWB was initially slated for the Pixel Watch 2 but failed to make the cut. With the Pixel Watch 3, you get UWB support with or without LTE connectivity. 

## How would UWB benefit owners of the Pixel Watch 3?

One way is by helping you find a missing device. With UWB enabled on the watch, you're able to track it down using a tool such as Google's [Find My Device app](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-enable-find-my-device-on-your-android-phone-and-why-you-should/) and [network](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-finally-launches-its-find-my-device-network-here-are-the-android-models-that-support-it/). 

**Also: [Gemini Live is finally available. Here's how you can access it (and why you'll want to)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gemini-live-is-finally-available-heres-how-you-can-access-it-and-why-youll-want-to/)**

Another UWB benefit suggested by Android Authority is unlocking your car. Several automakers already let you unlock your vehicle using your Android phone as a digital car key. Adding this tech to your smartwatch would mean you don't need to haul out your phone each time you want to get into your car. Plus, only certain Android phones support this feature, so a UWB-equipped watch would be handy.

## When will I be able to buy a Pixel Watch 3?

Google hosted its annual [Made by Google event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-announced-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) on August 13 this year (a couple of months earlier than usual) and unveiled the Pixel Watch 3, along with the Pixel 9 series of smartphones, the new Pixel Buds, and the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Pixel Watch 3 is available for pre-order now at the [Google store](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3) and [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-obsidian-band-lte-matte-black%2F6588312.p), with orders shipping at the beginning of September 2024\.
