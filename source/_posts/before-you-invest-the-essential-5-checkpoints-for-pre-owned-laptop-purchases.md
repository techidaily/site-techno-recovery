## Discover the Best Free Replacements for Photoshop Here
 Adobe Photoshop is the gold standard preferred by some of the world's top visual artists. Its powerful tools help photographers create almost anything the imagination conjures. But instead of paying the monthly fee if your budget is constrained or your use case is minimal, try a free, open-source alternative.

 Before you download a Photoshop alternative, plan for your specific needs. For example, not all of these options support[Adobe PSD format](https://www.lifewire.com/psd-file-2622194) . Others won't be able to recognize some multi-layered Photoshop files. If you need a key Photoshop feature, you'll find it easier to narrow your search by seeking an app that supports that specific function.

![GIMP free photoshop alternative](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RJaS9jqIkEMBw6cIrRcjeBZIiGA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linux_mixer-593adc983df78c537b3b14a5.jpg)

The GIMP Team

 What We Like

* Frequently updated with new features.
* Highly customizable and extensible.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited support for layers, macros, and custom shapes.
* Cluttered UI with annoying floating windows.

 One of the most full-featured Photoshop alternatives, GIMP (short for GNU Image Manipulation Program) offers such a large set of features that even the most complex tasks can be achieved without any strain on your budget. They say that you get what you pay for, but in GIMP's case, that idiom doesn't necessarily ring true. With a very active developer community that has historically listened to user requests and feedback, this free option continues to advance as raster editor technology expands.

 While not always as intuitive as Photoshop in terms of functionality and design, GIMP makes up for some of its perceived clumsiness with[several in-depth tutorials for both beginning and advanced users](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/) that help you use the majority of its components with little or no pre-existing knowledge of the open-source application. With that said, if you're only looking for the very basics in a raster-based graphics editor, then GIMP may be a little too much and you could benefit more from one of the simpler alternatives on our list.

 Similar to Photoshop, a large number of external plugins are available that enhance GIMP's functionality further. As always, download at your own risk when dealing with repositories that are not from Adobe.

 Available in several languages for the Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms, GIMP recognizes almost all file formats that you'd expect from a paid editor like Photoshop, including GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF, among others, as well as partial support for PSD files (not all layers may be readable).

## [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)

![An image open in the PAINT.net photo editing program](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wqs55WGJUiPE4IrDwz-UdwzwD08=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Screenshot2024-07-30125112-b276f1221a4046258d9a5239ab8eb6e6.png)

 What We Like

* Streamlined interface is a breeze to navigate.
* Helpful keyboard shortcuts.

 What We Don't Like

* UI lacks a tool for managing plug-ins.
* Text can't be edited after it's deselected.
* Deceptive download links on their website.

 A free Photoshop alternative strictly for Windows, the Paint.NET interface is reminiscent of the operating system's Paint application. The similarities are no coincidence, as the original developer intended to replace MS Paint with something a little better.

 That was a long time ago, and Paint.NET has since grown by leaps and bounds to the point where it's comparable in some ways to the more advanced editing software on the market, both free and paid. This includes the ability to use multiple layers and blending, all the while maintaining a fairly simple interface that lends itself to even the most novice user. If you do get stuck, the Paint.NET forums are an invaluable source for assistance where inquiries are sometimes answered in mere minutes. Couple that with the tutorials found on the same website and this Windows-only graphics editor offers a user-friendly experience.

 Although Paint.NET does not provide some of the higher-end functionality of Photoshop or even GIMP, its feature set can be expanded upon through the use of external plugins. For example, the application does not have built-in support for PSD files but can open Photoshop documents after the right plugin is installed.

 Paint.NET can run in over two dozen languages and is free to use on Windows for both business and commercial use with no restrictions.

 What We Like

* Extensive layer support with multiple blending modes.
* Includes built-in filters and adjustment tools.
* Incredibly easy to use.

 What We Don't Like

* No social media integration.
* Limits saving three images per day.

 A browser-based alternative to Photoshop, Pixlr is quite robust when it comes to available features. All the basics are included, including a retouch, text, and cutout tool. Leveraging AI, Pixlr also supports really neat features like generative fill and expand, face swap, and backdrop tools.

 Photos can be uploaded from your device or elsewhere on the internet with the URL and stock image functions. If you really can't find what you need, the AI image generator can get your creative juices flowing; browse creations made by other users or make something up on the spot that fits your project perfectly.

 In addition to working as an[online image editor](https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-photo-editors-1357096) , Pixlr also has free apps for Windows, Android, and iOS. There are some differences between the mobile and desktop apps, but with more than 50 million downloads from the Play Store, its popularity is pretty clear.

![Two layers visible in the Sumopaint online image editor](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6_H3Jd8mH-zb8zOPkwVRGfJyzXg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sumopaint-4cbe441867c5489aa19835730fec4765.png)

 What We Like

* Great layer support.
* Simple buttons and menus that are easy to understand.
* AI tools like a background remover, face fixer, and image generator.
* No user account necessary.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited shapes and file format support.
* No built-in tips for using unfamiliar tools.

 One of our personal favorites, SumoPaint's interface will look familiar if you have past Photoshop experience. The similarities are more than just skin deep, too, as its layering functionality and fairly wide range of editing tools, including several brushes and wand types, make it a formidable alternative.

 More intricate projects may not be suitable for SumoPaint, and its file support is somewhat limited and doesn't include Photoshop's default PSD format. Although, SVG, PDF, and even MP4 are supported input formats. Similar to Photoshop, SumoPaint supports saving to a custom format, called SUMO, if you wish to reopen layers. Otherwise, PNG, JPG, and PDF are the only other export formats.

 Some of this app's features are unique, like a QR code maker to convert URLs into that format, and a built-in library for importing 3D objects.

 This free alternative to Photoshop works in your browser and on devices that support Android apps.

## [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)

![Krita free photoshop alternative](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MGp2TLNkYLlp5AB7bPbv3oXO7cY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/user-interface30-592db40f3df78cbe7e66bc22.png)

The Krita Foundation

 What We Like

* Customizable interface.
* Brush tools feature detailed previews.

 What We Don't Like

* Consumes a lot of CPU resources.

 An interesting editing and painting tool, Krita is an open-source application that has seen its feature set expand significantly in recent years. With a nifty palette and a seemingly endless amount of brush customizations that can be stabilized to smooth out even the most unsteady hand, this Photoshop alternative supports most PSD files and offers advanced layer management.

 Free to download, the regularly updated desktop application also uses OpenGL and allows you to author and manipulate HDR images — among many other benefits.

 Available for Linux, Mac, ​and Windows, Krita boasts a fairly active forum containing sample artwork created by members of its user community.​

## [Adobe Photoshop Express](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-express.html)

![A photo open in Adobe Photoshop Express](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P07sdRvQ4FP28HInwYHEc6puei4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/adobe-photoshop-express-74ccd1d0e8a249caa9c70f8ba404639b.png)

Adobe

 What We Like

* Load a photo from your PC or directly from the webcam.
* Long list of import formats.

 What We Don't Like

* Only saves to JPG.
* Relatively basic.

 While Adobe charges a fee to use its main Photoshop software, the company does offer free image editing tools in the form of the Photoshop Express application. This surprisingly capable app allows you to enhance and tweak your photos in a number of ways.

 In addition to correcting problems like red eye with a single click or tap, Photoshop Express also makes it easy to apply unique effects and incorporate borders. The View Original toggle is fun to use as it shows how your edits have affected the original photo. There's also an Auto Enhance button for quick edits, a spot healing brush, and several crop tools for making the perfect photo for Etsy, Pinterest, YouTube, etc.

 This free Photoshop tool is available as an app for Windows, phones, and tablets.
