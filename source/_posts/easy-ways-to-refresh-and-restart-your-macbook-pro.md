## Boost Efficiency with Dual Task Management - Learn How to Split Screens on Your MacBook Air Today
### What to Know

* Hover your mouse over the**Green Circle** (full-screen button) in the left corner of an open window.
* Click**Tile Window to Left of Screen** or**Tile Window to Right Screen** .
* Click an open window on the other side of your screen to snap it into place beside your original window.

 This article includes instructions on how to split-screen on a MacBook Air computer, including how to use split-screen, add windows in split-screen, and what to do if split-screen isn't working on your computer.

 Split View is only available for[macOS 10.15 Catalina](https://www.lifewire.com/macos-catalina-4692636) or later. On older versions of macOS, you’ll need to use a different method to access a similar feature, explained below. If you still can’t access it, make sure your MacBook Air’s system software is up to date.

## What Is the Shortcut for Split Screen on Mac?

 Having more than one monitor is essential if you regularly work with multiple windows or apps at the same time on your MacBook Air. However, if you don’t have access to an external monitor, macOS has a built-in solution: Split View.

 Split View (or split-screen view) lets you view two apps or windows side-by-side on your MacBook screen without having to resize them or drag windows around manually. This article teaches you what you need to know about this helpful feature, including how to access it and how to swap between different apps while it’s active.

 To launch Split View, follow the steps below:  

1. Hover your mouse over the**Green Circle** (full-screen button) in the left corner of an open window. A drop-down menu should appear.

6. If you’d like one window to be larger than the other, you can resize them by clicking and dragging the border between the two windows. Both windows will still fill the entire screen.  
 In macOS Monterey (12.0) and later, you can also swap out apps in Split View and make either pane switch to full screen.

7. To exit Split View, hover over the top of the screen until the grey menu bar reappears. Next, hover over the green circle button and select**Exit Full Screen** . Alternatively, you can click the green circle button.

 Sometimes, exiting full screen will cause one of your windows to disappear. If this happens to you, it’s most likely because something put the window in a separate view in[Mission Control.](https://www.lifewire.com/assign-mac-apps-to-open-in-specific-desktop-space-2260812) On your keyboard, tap**F3** (it looks like a series of rectangles) to open Mission Control, and you should see your lost window in the bar at the top of your screen.

## How to Open Other Apps in Split View

## Why Won't My Mac Do Split Screen?  

 If you can’t access Split View on your Mac, it’s most likely because your operating system is outdated.  
 For Macs running macOS Mojave, High Sierra, Sierra, or El Capitan, you can try the following steps to enter a split-screen view:  

   1. Click and hold the green circle button.  
   2. The window should shrink. Drag it to the left or right side of the screen.  
   3. Release the button and click a window on the other side of the screen. They should now be arranged side-by-side.  
 If you have macOS Catalina or later installed and still can’t access Split View, make sure it’s enabled by following the steps below:
   8. Click the**Apple Menu** .
   9. Select**System Preferences** .
