## Enhancing Security: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Next-Gen Android Anti-Theft Features Explained

Google

Your Android phone is about to get an AI-powered anti-theft upgrade that can keep your personal information safe. 

In May of this year, Google teased a new [Theft Detection Lock tool](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-15-unveiled-here-are-8-new-exciting-features-coming-to-your-phone/) for Android phones. Expected to debut with [Android 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-15-unveiled-here-are-8-new-exciting-features-coming-to-your-phone/), the feature would sense a device's motion -- such as someone snatching a phone and then running, biking, or driving away -- and immediately lock the screen, Google said.

According to [Android journalist Mishaal Rahman](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1824486500022751671), Theft Detection Lock is finally rolling out.

How does the feature work? Google explains that AI uses your phone's gyroscope and accelerometer to watch for "common motion associated with theft." Exactly what those motions are wasn't detailed, but it's likely a quick jerk or jolt followed by rapid acceleration. If the tool detects those motions, it immediately locks your phone screen.

For now, Rahman said, the tool is rolling out to a limited number of users in Brazil who signed up for Google's beta program. When the feature does roll out fully, it will probably start with newer Google phones but will eventually be available on all Android 10+ devices, or essentially any modern Android phone.

Google included the anti-theft detection tool with several other security additions it announced earlier this year to protect your data "before, during and after a theft," including:

* Making it more difficult to factory reset a phone and set it up under a new account
* Private spaces to hide sensitive apps
* The ability to mark your phone as lost on [Find My Device](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-enable-find-my-device-on-your-android-phone-and-why-you-should/) for easier tracking
* Automatic lock for excessive failed authentication
* The ability to lock your phone if it's offline
* Remote lock, which lets you lock your phone's screen using just your number and a quick security challenge

Google will make the new tools available through a Google Play services update later this year. Some features will be available only in Android 15.
