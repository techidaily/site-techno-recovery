![iPhone 16 in hand](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/277b853e12d397c1fe466d78603a7aa85a5685bf/2024/09/09/e0da3045-825d-4c4a-9ae4-f2eff280cba2/dsc01901.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

During its [recent 'Glowtime' event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/), Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 16 series which consists of four unique models: the base device, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro, and the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max.

All iPhone releases are momentous occasions, but this one is special because it arguably introduces some of the biggest upgrades in the series' history. iOS will never be the same again moving forward. We saw design changes, hardware updates, the implementation of Apple Intelligence, and more. The presentation was packed with reveals; both big and small. So to make things easy for you, we're highlighting four of the best features for the iPhone 16 line.

## 1\. Apple Intelligence

Siri has finally received its long-awaited update, becoming "smarter" than ever before. The AI assistant has a richer understanding of language thanks to Apple Intelligence. Siri can now maintain context even when a user makes multiple requests. Plus it can continue following along even if you stumble over your words. If you have any burning questions about any Apple products, the AI has more extensive product knowledge to help you shop.

The updates don't stop there. Apple Intelligence enables so much more. They include but are not limited to, Writing Tools to help you edit text, call recordings for the Phone app, notification summaries, and Private Cloud Compute for enhancing the device's processing power. 

Apple Intelligence will not be available at launch. It'll roll out in October as a software upgrade in the United States and in English only. It'll be available in more countries like the United Kingdom later this December. And in 2025, it'll expand to other languages like Spanish.

## 2\. Camera Upgrades

Apple showed off so many camera updates at the event that it is impossible to talk about every single one in detail, but we're going to try. First, the main lens on the iPhone 16 will be the new 48MP Fusion Camera. It can take wide-angle shots like previous generations. Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away.

Below the power button is a new tactile switch called [Camera Control](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/). It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it'll soon become accessible on third-party apps.

## 3\. Eye-catching colors

Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we've seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. 

The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they've been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.

## 4\. Design changes bring other benefits

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

There's more to the iPhone 16's design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We've already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the "latest-generation Ceramic Shield", making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.

**Also: [Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple's iOS 18 (and which ones won't)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/)**

Apple even updated the iPhone 16's internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.
