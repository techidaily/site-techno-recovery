There’s no doubt that VitalSource, as the leading provider of online textbooks and course materials, is a good place for students, teachers, and researchers to shop for eTextbooks as it saves up to 80% of textbooks and gives users instant access to over a million online textbooks anytime, anywhere and on any device. However, the textbooks purchased from VitalSource website and downloaded via its Bookshelf application are saved in **vbk files** which are VitalSource proprietary files with DRM protection and can only be read on its own VitalSource Bookshelf software.

It does allow you to print your downloaded book to PDF using VitalSource Bookshelf, but it only lets you print 1 page at a time, and manually doing this for the entire book is tedious and time consuming. What a huge project it would be if the book you’d like to print covers hundreds of pages! So it’s indispensable to break the printing limitation and print the entire book at a time with 1-click. In this article, I’ll introduce you **the most effortless and cost-effective solution to print VitalSource books to PDF as a whole**.
