 This app integrates with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch to type on the go. It does not support a stylus. Also, like other alternatives, the Pro version opens up a lot more customization power, including editing actions and themes and custom tagging.

**Price** : Free; monthly and Pro version memberships
