## Top-Rated Protective Sleeves for the Newest Google Pixel Fold - Recommended Models of 2024 Reviewed by Tech Experts

Thanks to their ability to pack large displays into compact, pocketable handsets, foldable phones are on the rise to possibly become the [next big thing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/are-foldable-phones-the-next-big-thing/) for smartphones. And with its latest release, [Google is officially](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-unveils-pixel-fold-the-thinnest-foldable-phone-on-the-market/) in the fold. The [Google Pixel Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-fold-review/), powered by Google's own Tensor G2 chipset, features up to 24 hours of battery life, a comprehensive camera suite, and exclusive foldable camera features. 

**Review:** [**Google Pixel Fold: Samsung's first big competitor comes out swinging**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-fold-review/)

After testing the Fold ourselves, we can say that the two-screened [$1,799 handset](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Fold-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0C34JPQ4Y%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C56796405-2aa4-4ebb-ab49-0309010f8c10%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is easily on our best foldable phone list, and worth it for those who love the Pixel experience or want to make the slab-to-foldable smartphone switch with a small learning curve. But if you're thinking of purchasing, keep in mind that you now have two screens to protect instead of just the one. Investing in a solid case can help grant peace of mind and in-tact screens. 

To help you start your case-buying journey, we've rounded up some of the best Pixel Fold cases you can purchase right now that perfectly fit the latest Google foldable, starting with the case we employed while testing the phone, [Google's very own Pixel Fold case](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Ffold%5Fcase?).

Pros 
* Made by Google for Google
* Colors match that of Google's color palate
* Sleek
* Wireless charging

Cons 
* Pricier than others on the list

### Google Pixel Fold Case

#### Best Google Pixel Fold case overall

**Google Pixel Fold case features:** **Colors:** Obsidian, Hazel, and Bay | **Material:** Polycarbonate, silicone, and microfiber

To accompany the phone itself, Google has manufactured [its own](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-this-the-best-pixel-fold-case-right-now-heres-googles-very-own/) 34.3-gram case in sleek, black with green undertones. Google calls Hazel a pretty close-to-perfect compliment to the Obsidian phone. Additionally, there's Porcelain, subtle beige which when paired with the Porcelain phone gives a minimalist, monochromatic aesthetic. Finally, there's a beautiful baby blue which Google has named Sky that adds a pop of color to any model. 

**Also:** [**Is this the best Pixel Fold case right now? Here's Google's very own**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-this-the-best-pixel-fold-case-right-now-heres-googles-very-own/)

The case lines both screens and still allows for flexibility as the phone folds in and out. Perfectly fit to protect the phone's more square, defined borders and vertical hinge, the case is durable to protect against those clumsy moments where gravity wins. Lined with microfiber on the inside, the case is ready to absorb shock, but is still soft and slim to the touch with a silicone and polycarbonate shell. Additionally, the case's opening along the phone's hinge makes it compatible with both sides of the phone.

Pros 
* Polycarbonate material promises heavy duty protection
* Ergonomic hold
* Completely covers hinge
* Wireless charging

Cons 
* Only comes in black
* May add slight bulk

### Caseology Parallax case

#### The best durable Google Pixel Fold case

**Caseology Parallax case features:** **Colors:** Black | **Materials:** Polycarbonate 

Protecting two screens is no small feat, so if you need some heavy duty protection, this polycarbonate-based case from Caseology is ready to do the trick. It has a slim and functional form factor, promising an ergonomic hold and complete hinge coverage. 

In addition to the Polycarbonate back panels and TPU-lined edges, there's an adhesive strip that adds even more security and that "grippy" feel. To fit the already slightly chunky fold phone, the case is relatively slim but may still add some bulk because of its heavy-duty status. But hey, I'll take a thicker phone over a broken one.

Pros 
* Minimalist design
* Impact absorbent
* Lightweight
* Wireless charging

Cons 
* Transparency could show accumulated dust
* Hard shell could crack after multiple uses

### Zeking Clear case

#### Best affordable Google Pixel Fold case 

**Zeking Clear case** **features: Color:** Clear | **Materials:** Polycarbonate, Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)

If you're a minimalist and want the beautiful Pixel 7a colors to shine without paying a possible upcharge for Google's matching cases, Zeking's clear case offers a transparent design and durable build for only $12\. Made with the ever-reliable polycarbonate and cushioned with TPU bumper, the case promises drop-proof protection for both screens when folded hot-dog style or in tablet mode. 

The hardshell case fits on nicely, offering raised edges on all four corners for ultra-protection if you, like me, have a bad habit of accidentally clanking your phone as you briskly walk past your desk or kitchen table. Offering full visible transparency, this case also promises unobtrusive use of buttons, speakers, and cameras.

#### Best Google Pixel Fold case to look out for

**Dbrand Pixel Fold Grip Case features:** **Material:** TPU grippy textured frame; Polycarbonate back; Metal and TPU kickstand | **Colors:** 14 "premium" and 21 "classic." 

Like the Google Pixel Fold phone [itself](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-unveils-pixel-fold-the-thinnest-foldable-phone-on-the-market/), this dbrand case promises ultimate multi-functionality. Featuring a sleek kickstand built into the case's protective hinge cover, the case allows for hands-free calling and really lets the phone shine as a mini tablet for entertainment purposes. 

At just 2mm thin, the Grip Case likely won't add too much bulk to a phone. And to its name, the case's "grip strips" along the edges allow for a firmer hold, making it the "world's grippiest phone case," according to dbrand. Additionally, the case boasts military-grade impact resistance, camera protection, and is specifically made with Google's tech in mind. 

The case is currently available to preorder on dbrand's website for $60 and expected to ship in June.

## How did we choose these Google Pixel fold phone cases?

Ahead of Google's official fold phone announcement, we researched some of the cases that started popping up on the market. To curate this list, we considered cases best fit to protect the fold's unique form factor, the overall feel of the case, and the price point. 

* **Durability:** The case is first and foremost a means of protection, and now that the Fold offers two screens to protect in both tablet and smartphone mode, durability was a priority. That said, we looked to see what materials the case was made with, such as polycarbonate and TPU, and how the case was engineered – was it lined with microfiber for impact resistance, does it have rounded edges, was the hinge fully protected, etc.
* **Feel:** Ultimately, phone cases are an accessory, so why not make it nice to look at and interact with? A grippy texture that doesn't compromise an easy slip into the pocket and ergonomic hold.
* **Price:** Phones already cost a pretty penny, with lots of great, durable case options out there, there's no reason to blow your budget on a case.

## Do you need a phone case?

A phone case can help protect your phone from the realities of gravity, life, or your own clumsiness. Investing in a good case upfront can also help you save on future phone repair costs or increase your chances of [trading in](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-place-to-sell-trade-old-phone-computer-tech/) your phone for a better deal. 

## Does Polycarbonate protect your phone?

Used commonly in engineering, polycarbonate is a durable plastic that many phone cases began to employ for increased durability. 

## When does the Google Pixel Fold come out?

The Google Pixel Fold was announced Wednesday, May 10, and is available for pre-order right now. Google says the device will start to ship later next month.
