As we approach [WWDC 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-confirms-wwdc-2024-for-june-10-will-ai-steal-the-show/) on June 10, it's clear that this will be among the most important developer events in Apple's history. The progress made by competitors such as Microsoft and Google -- who have incorporated significant generative AI features into their products and services -- means Apple must not merely catch up but surpass their advancements.

Recently, Microsoft integrated the GPT-4-based [Copilot](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-copilot-formerly-bing-chat-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) into its latest [Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite X-based PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-lenovos-new-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-and-theyre-scary-thin/), and Google is incorporating its [Deepmind Gemini GenAI models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-openai-sweating-9-google-features-announced-for-gemini-search-android-and-more/) across its ecosystem. Apple, as of now, is behind.

**Also: [The M4 iPad Pro's true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/)**

Apple's hardware, including the AI-powered M4 chip, has tremendous potential. However, [hardware alone is insufficient](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/). Consumers are looking for significant software innovations that enhance their user experience. Apple must demonstrate that its hardware advancements are crucial for the next generation of digital experiences, unlocking new AI capabilities and augmented reality interactions.
