As we approach [WWDC 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-confirms-wwdc-2024-for-june-10-will-ai-steal-the-show/) on June 10, it's clear that this will be among the most important developer events in Apple's history. The progress made by competitors such as Microsoft and Google -- who have incorporated significant generative AI features into their products and services -- means Apple must not merely catch up but surpass their advancements.

Recently, Microsoft integrated the GPT-4-based [Copilot](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-copilot-formerly-bing-chat-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) into its latest [Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite X-based PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-lenovos-new-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-and-theyre-scary-thin/), and Google is incorporating its [Deepmind Gemini GenAI models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-openai-sweating-9-google-features-announced-for-gemini-search-android-and-more/) across its ecosystem. Apple, as of now, is behind.

**Also: [The M4 iPad Pro's true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/)**

Apple's hardware, including the AI-powered M4 chip, has tremendous potential. However, [hardware alone is insufficient](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/). Consumers are looking for significant software innovations that enhance their user experience. Apple must demonstrate that its hardware advancements are crucial for the next generation of digital experiences, unlocking new AI capabilities and augmented reality interactions. What we see revealed at next week's WWDC could fundamentally change how users interact with their devices.

## 3\. Integrate seamlessly with third-party services and partner with multiple AI providers

To offer the best AI experiences, Apple must integrate its AI services with various third-party platforms and partner with multiple AI and service providers, not just OpenAI and [ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), as the company is expected to do. For example, Siri could provide personalized shopping recommendations by integrating with Amazon and Instacart. It could remind users to reorder items or suggest products based on past behavior. 

Collaborating with financial services like Plaid, especially with Apple Card, could offer comprehensive financial insights, including budgeting advice, expense tracking, and alerting users to unusual account activity. 

**Also: [Make room for RAG: How Gen AI's balance of power is shifting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/make-room-for-rag-how-gen-ais-balance-of-power-is-shifting/)**

While Watch, Fitness+, and Health are the company's preferred health platforms, excluding third-party health data providers from its AI infrastructure would be inadvisable. Partnering with health and fitness apps like MyFitnessPal and Fitbit would allow Apple's AI to offer tailored workout plans and nutrition advice while seamlessly monitoring health metrics. AI could work with platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera in education to provide personalized learning recommendations and track educational progress.

Apple should also incorporate [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/make-room-for-rag-how-gen-ais-balance-of-power-is-shifting/) (RAG), which combines generative language models with information retrieval techniques to access external knowledge sources and incorporate real-time data into responses. 

Partnering with multiple AI providers, including specialists in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning, will bring cutting-edge innovations and accelerate the development of advanced features across Apple's ecosystem. This multi-partner approach reduces the risk of over-reliance on a single provider, increases resilience, and allows Apple to tailor AI solutions to different markets and user segments.

AI can enhance contextual awareness by integrating with sensors and data sources on Apple devices. For example, starting a workout on Fitness+ could prompt AI to suggest a matching Apple Music playlist, monitor health metrics in real-time with Apple Watch, and provide motivational prompts. AI can analyze user behavior to offer smart recommendations for content, activities, and products, acting as a personal assistant attuned to individual tastes.

Proactive health and wellness features could remind users to take medication via the Health app, suggest wellness tips based on activity levels tracked by Apple Watch, and offer mental health support through mindfulness reminders. Personalized routines on Apple devices, like HomePod adjusting lighting based on daily habits, will enhance user experiences.

## 6\. Ensure AI shines across all products and services

Given Apple's extensive range of consumer products, generative AI capabilities must excel across every product in the ecosystem. I think I can speak for every Apple product user that enhancing Siri to make its responses more relevant and intelligent is crucial, but generative AI must also improve experiences in Apple Music, Apple News, Health, Fitness+, and TV.

In Apple Music, AI could create personalized playlists and provide music recommendations based on user preferences. In Apple News, AI could curate personalized news feeds and summarize articles.

**Also: [Move over, Alexa and HomeKit: A new Assistant is here to open source your smart home](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/move-over-alexa-and-homekit-a-new-assistant-is-here-to-open-source-your-smart-home/)**

In Health and Fitness+, AI could offer tailored workout routines and personalized wellness tips, while Apple Watch could provide deeper health insights and track fitness goals.

For Apple TV, AI could improve content discovery by recommending shows based on viewing history and offering interactive features like real-time trivia.

Leveraging AI to enhance HomeKit's capabilities is essential, especially since HomeKit isn't a market leader in home automation. AI can offer smarter home automation by predicting user behavior to automate lights, thermostat settings, and security systems. 

Integrating AI across all devices ensures a seamless user experience. Preferences and data from one device would then inform recommendations on another, creating a unified ecosystem.

## How Apple wins the generative AI race

Apple's success in the AI race hinges on its ability to innovate and outperform competitors. By developing a clear on-device strategy, deploying AI-accelerated devices at the edge, and partnering with multiple AI and service providers, Apple can ensure comprehensive integration and enhanced user experiences.
