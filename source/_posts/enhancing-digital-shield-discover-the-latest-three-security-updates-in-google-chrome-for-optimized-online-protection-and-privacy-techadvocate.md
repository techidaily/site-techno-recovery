Online threats and privacy concerns seem to be ever more salient as users are becoming more and more aware of the lack of safeguards online. Now, Google is rolling out three new and improved features to Chrome aimed at beefing up your safety and security.

In a blog post published Thursday, Chrome product manager Andrew Kamau described the new features and explained how they're designed to better protect you from online threats.

## 1\. New and improved Safety Check

First up, getting a tune-up is Chrome's [Safety Check](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-google-chrome-user-should-click-this-button/). Designed to uncover malicious downloads, compromised passwords, unsupported extensions, and other hazards, this new and improved version will automatically run in the background to scan for more types of threats.

Safety Check will be able to revoke permissions from sites you no longer use, alert you to potentially unwanted website notifications, and remind you of any security or privacy issues that need your attention. It will also keep you abreast of the actions it takes so you're not caught off guard.

**Also: [What is DuckDuckGo? If you're into online privacy, try this popular Google alternative](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-duckduckgo-if-youre-into-online-privacy-try-this-popular-google-alternative/)** 

Further, Safety Check will try to protect you against abusive notifications by automatically revoking permissions from sites considered deceptive by [Google's Safe Browsing service](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-now-better-protects-you-against-risky-websites-and-weak-passwords/). With Chrome on a computer, Safety Check will also alert you to any extensions that might be a security risk and take you to the extensions page where you can remove them.

## 2\. Remove website notifications

Unwanted website notifications can not only be annoying but potentially hazardous, and Chrome will now make it easier to opt out of them. Now on Pixel phones and coming soon to other Android devices, a new "Unsubscribe" button will appear in the notifications drawer so you can quickly turn off notifications for a particular site.

## 3\. Grant one-time website permissions

Lastly, Chrome on Android devices and computers will now let you grant one-time permissions to specific websites. You'll be able to allow certain permissions, such as access to the camera or microphone, for one time only. After you exit the site, those permissions are revoked and must be granted again the next time you browse to that site.

Kamau didn't specify whether these new features will automatically roll out to all Chrome users or whether you need to update the browser to grab them. However, updating your browser to the latest version is typically a good idea as you gain custody of the latest security updates and bug fixes.
