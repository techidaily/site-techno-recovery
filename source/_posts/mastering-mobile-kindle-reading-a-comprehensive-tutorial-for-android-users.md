Reading Kindle books can be an excellent experience for all book lovers, especially when you consider the variety and prices of Kindle ebooks. Initially, Kindle books were only available on Kindle eReader devices, but nowadays, you can freely read Kindle books on any mobile device. Since more and more people are purchasing low-cost but powerful Android devices, this guide will tell you how to read Kindle books on an Android phone/tablet.

Before reading Kindle books on Android device, we should first install the Kindle reader app for Android.

* [Method 3\. Read Kindle Books on Android Emulator](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Method 1\. Read Kindle Books on Android with Kindle Android App

The Kindle app is the official app released by Amazon, available for free download for all users. Almost every app store on Android devices provides the Kindle app, including the Google Play Store. Simply search for "Kindle" on Google Play and tap the Kindle icon to install it on your Android phone/tablet.

![install kindle app to android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/install-kindle-app-to-android.jpg)

When Kindle App has been installed to Android device, we can easily read Kindle books on our Android tablets and smartphones. The complete guide can be concluded as the following steps.

Step 1 Launch Kindle App for Android and register it with your Amazon Kindle account.

If you don't have an Amazon account yet, just create a new Amazon account.

![register kindle app for android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/register-kindle-android-app.jpg)

Step 2 Purchase (free) Kindle books to an Android phone/tablet (Internet connection required).

If you don't have any Kindle book, you can find many free books or purchase some books on Amazon website. Just tap the "Store" button at the bottom to go to the Kindle ebook store.

![Kindle store on android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-store-android.jpg)

Note: Amazon has disabled in-app book purchases as of June 1, 2022\. But you can visit amazon.com in your device browser and purchase books, then the purchased books will be synced to your kindle library. 

Step 3 Download (free) Kindle books to Android phone/tablet.

All your purchased Kindle books in your account will be synced to the "Library" automatically, together with the related notes, highlights and the latest reading page. Just tap any book cover and it will be downloaded to your Android device.

![Kindle library on android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-app-android-library.jpg)

Step 4 Read Kindle books on Android phone/tablet.

All the downloaded books are displayed under the "downloaded" tab in the "Library". Tap a title to open and read it. Holding down a word enables users to note, highlight and do other operations (search in Book, search Wikipedia or search the Web).

### Method 2\. Read Kindle Books on Android with Any eBook Reader for Android

Many people have complained about the Kindle app on Android frequently crashing and express a preference for using a better ebook reader to read Kindle books. Is it possible to read Kindle books with your favorite reading app on Android? Absolutely! However, before doing so, you need to take some additional steps to make your Kindle books compatible with your ebook reader. It is well known that Kindle books are DRM-protected and have their own format, which is not supported by other readers. Here is the solution.

Step 1 [Remove DRM from Kindle books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and convert Kindle books to EPUB or PDF with [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).

### Method 3\. Read Kindle Books on Android Emulator

Hi KMF,  
 We write different articles from different angles to cover different readers.

 And this post if for those pure tech rookies.

 So what do you want to know about reading Kindle books on Android? Maybe we can answer your questions in private, or write another post.

Hi Ongakuka,

 I am not sure if the Kindle app is able to recognize a serie of books.

 However you can create colletion to organize your books in my experience.

I find it hard to start a book I have downloaded to Samsung Galaxy Ace 3.  
 Recommended reads come up on the screen and wont move when I tap the screen.  
 I have to tap everything to finally get to read something, and half the time a book I have already read puts me on the final page.  
 It is all so damn annoying as it is not as easy as the Kindle for PC.  
 I wish there was a detailed walkthrough to guide me (and others) who have similar problems.

This is a great post and everything but LET'S FACE REALITY: Most people who publish Kindle books NEVER MAKE ANY MONEY!

 There's no getting around this harsh truth.

 Why?

 They did not publish the RIGHT book.

 It does not get any simpler than that. 

 Your book must be in a CATEGORY that SELLS! Just because you think a topic is 'hot' doesn't mean someone else will agree with you. Worse yet, just because you're excited about your  
 topic doesn't mean peoople will actually PAY HARD-EARNED CASH for your book.

 Next, even if you did pick the right niche, you need to make sure it is well-written.

 Sadly, very few Kindle authors know how to write... for KINDLE! Fiverr or upwork are NOT great places for Kindle talent. You need tried and proven writers. Do a search on Google for "Gene Eugenio writer" to find an experienced writer who will write a full book for only $99 or some other similar affordable service.. There's a few of them. I only listed Ozki because of their relatively low pricing.

 Third, you need to SELL an AUTHOR BRAND. Kindle books are not commodities. Best selling authors make BANK because they sell a whole SERIES of books to their fans. You can do the same by making sure your   
 writer writes your book to string them into a SERIES!

 Keep the 3 tips above in mind if you're serious about getting a snowball's chance in hell of actually making money on Kindle.

 The bottom line? Kindle publishing IS NO JOKE

I've googled this with no good result. How do I find the equivalent of the Kindle back button on an Android phone running Kindle software?

My China smartphone is Hisense A5 running on Android 9 os, but the phone does not have (and cannot install) Google Play Store. Hisense A5 is an e-ink smartphone running on its proprietary Hisense OS (version L1657.6.12.01.00). I searched and downloaded the Amazon Kindle app from Huawei's App Gallery, but the app directed me to the Amazon China Kindle store instead. Please help.

Please change the marketplace to amazon.com and then register it with your amazon account.
