 There was a time when you only needed a phone number to get on Messenger, but a Facebook account is necessary these days.

##  How to Make a New Messenger Account Without Facebook

 Did you permanently delete Facebook or have you never had a Facebook account? It's easy to make a Messenger account because you get one automatically when you create a Facebook account. Then, you can turn off Facebook and keep using Messenger. Here's how:

1. [ Make a Facebook account](https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610) . You can do this through the website, the Messenger app, or the Facebook app. Select**Create new account** and then follow the on-screen steps.

2. [ Deactivate your Facebook account](https://www.lifewire.com/deactivate-facebook-5072237) . This is like a pause, so you can reactivate any time. Messenger will still work if you do this, but nobody will be able to find you on Facebook and your timeline will be inaccessible.  
 Deleting your account is very different. Play close attention to the option you choose. Deleting Facebook**will** delete Messenger.
