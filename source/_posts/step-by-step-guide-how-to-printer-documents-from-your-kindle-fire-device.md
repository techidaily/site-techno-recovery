Nowadays, we are living in a world on the go, people have been used to handle all kinds of jobs with laptops, cellphones, and tablets. Kindle Fire, a super nova in the gadget world, is certainly showed up in many people's hands, we use it to listen to music and podcast, watch movies and TV Shows, read all the classic public domains and best sellers, we even use it to check emails and process business documents.

As to process business documents, we always need to print them out. But it seems impossible to achieve this goal with Kindle Fire because it doesn't offer any "print" function and we can't plug it to a printer either.

Therefore this guide post is born as the times require. You can learn more than one way for printing Kindle Fire via a wireless printer and other magic tricks.

### Print Documents/ Webpages/ eMails from Kindle Fire with Google Cloud Print

Google Cloud Print is the most convenient way to do this trick, because you don't need a wireless printer but just a regular printer installed on a PC which has been connected to Google Cloud Print center. And there are many third-party apps on Kindle Fire that can help you easily connect your Kindle Fire to GCP, in this post I will recommend you some ones. BTW, if you are not using Kindle Fire but other Android tablets or cellphone, this guide also suits you well.

First of all, you should make your printer ready for the GCP. (A Chrome browser is needed.)

After making your printer Cloud Ready, now let's do some tricks on your Kindle Fire.

**Note: After December 31, 2020, Google Cloud Print will no longer be supported.**

### Print PDF from Kindle Fire (Add a Printer)

If you're printing for the first time, you'll need to Add a Printer to Your Fire Tablet. 

To print a PDF, you'd better download an office program or PDF viewer from the Amazon Appstore. For example, Mopria Print Service app, Android Default Print Service.

Amazon Fire 5 and 6 tablets already have the Mopria Print Service pre-installed on the device and it’s ready for easy mobile printing. 

![mopria print service app](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-printer-kindle-fire.png)

Open the file you want to print, select a nearby printer, print. 

You can also print from Amazon Fire 7 tablets using the Android Default Print Service that will automatically connect to Mopria certified printers and MFPs. 

If your printer is not be displayed, you can add a printer on a wifi network or directly to the printer.

1\. Is your printer and your KF in the same WiFi network?  
 2\. Has you installed the print-assistant app on your KF?
