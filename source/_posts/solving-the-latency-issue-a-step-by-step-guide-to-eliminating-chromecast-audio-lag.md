## Solving the Latency Issue: A Step-by-Step Guide to Eliminating Chromecast Audio Lag

Close 

 Problems with Chromecast audio delays may appear in one of several different ways:

* The video on the television is moving faster than the audio.
* Audio and video temporarily align and then fall out of sync.
* You may hear audio while the video lags behind the sound, or there's no video at all.

 Chromecast audio delay is more common when your home Wi-Fi network is slow or too many people are streaming content simultaneously. However, there could be other causes for this problem as well.

 If you have Chromecast audio delays all the time, this points toward network speed issues. However, if the audio delay only happens sometimes, it could indicate other network activity interfering with your Chromecast stream.

##  Causes of Chromecast Audio Delay Problems 

 Issues with Chromecast audio delays are usually caused by network problems, device connection problems with the Chromecast, the device's distance from the Chromecast, or speaker latency.
