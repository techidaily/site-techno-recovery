The beauty of these color-matched cases is that they just look like a protective enhancement of the phone itself, rather than a bulky afterthought. 

ZDNET's June Wan [tested the case](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-7a-review/)himself and was impressed by the color matching along with its "grippy" texture and perfect fit. He also liked how it didn't compromise the precise "click" of the buttons. While not the most rugged case, Wan promises that it's still pretty durable, with the rounded edges protecting against bumps and drops.
