2. Press the**Home** button on your LG TV remote.
3. In your App List, select the**Hulu** app.

## How to Install the Hulu App

 If you don't see Hulu in your App List, you can install it from the LG store:

1. Press the**Home** button on your LG TV remote.
2. In your App List, select**Apps** or**LG Content Store** on older LG TVs.
3. Select the**Search** icon at the top of the screen, then search for**Hulu** .  
 If you don't see Hulu in the search results, your LG TV doesn't support the Hulu app, so you'll have to use a different method.

 On some models, you'll be prompted to log in to your LG account before adding or updating apps.

## Which LG TVs Support Hulu?

 All LG smart TVs that run webOS 3.5 or higher come with the Hulu app already installed. Most LG TVs running webOS 3.0 support Hulu except for the B6, UH6350, UH6330, UH77, UH76, and UH61 series.

 Your model or serial number can be found on the back of your TV. On some LG TVs, you can bring up model information by pressing the**Mute** button on the remote three times.  

 If[Hulu isn't working](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hulu-not-working-5096089) on your LG TV, delete and reinstall the app to ensure you have the latest version.

## Other Ways to Watch Hulu on an LG TV

 Other ways to[watch Hulu on a TV](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-hulu-on-your-tv-3486665) include hooking up your computer to the TV or connecting a streaming device like a Google Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire Stick.
