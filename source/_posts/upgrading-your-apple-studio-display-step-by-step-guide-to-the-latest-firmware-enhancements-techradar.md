Look out, [AirPods Pro 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-used-my-airpods-pro-2-since-their-2022-release-are-they-still-worth-it-in-2024/) users, a new [firmware update (v7A294)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340) has arrived that contains features you're going to want. 

In particular, the new update adds Siri interactions, making it possible to interact with your phone without having your phone in hand. This feature is possible thanks to machine learning on the H2 chip that can detect head movements, such as a node or a shake. In other words, you can tell Siri yes or no without uttering a syllable. This is especially important for those who tend to use their AirPods Pro 2 earbuds in environments where speaking out loud might be frowned upon.

**Also: [Get the AirPods Pro 2 (that can turn into a hearing aid) for 24% off right now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/airpods-pro-deal-09-12-24/)**

Another feature that uses the H2 chip is voice isolation, which vastly improves how you sound during phone calls. This new feature isolates your voice from background noise, almost eliminating distractions. Wind, running water, fans, AC units -- all of these sounds will be removed entirely or greatly reduced during calls. Voice Isolation is enabled by default.

Once you've updated your firmware, you'll also find improved latency for gaming as well as better voice quality via 16-bit 47kHz audio for discussion during game sessions. The Personalized Volume feature (that adjusts sound levels based on changes in your environment) has also been given a boost as it now learns over time.

Unfortunately, the Hearing Aid and Hearing Test features did not make it into this update. The [FDA recently approved AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fda-approves-apples-new-hearing-aid-feature-for-airpods-pro-2/) as a software-based hearing solution but the hearing features will not be available until sometime later this fall.

## Updating your firmware

To update the firmware for your AirPods Pro 2, you'll first need to ensure your phone has been updated to [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-in-ios-18-1-developer-beta-heres-whats-new-for-iphone/). Once that's done, make sure the earbuds are connected to your iPhone and launch the update by listening to music for about 30 seconds. Then return the earbuds to the case. Make sure to close the case and keep it closed and positioned next to your phone. Once the update is complete, the earbuds will automatically disconnect and you'll be ready to enjoy the new features.
