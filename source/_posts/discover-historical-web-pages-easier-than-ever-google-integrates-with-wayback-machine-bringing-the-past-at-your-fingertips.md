Ever wonder what a particular website looked like 10, 15, or even 25 years ago? The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is a great way to view the internet of the past -- and now you can tap into its historical archives directly through [Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-google-search-results-are-about-to-look-very-different-here-are-4-reasons-why/).

Starting today, anyone running a Google search can access a link to the Internet Archive to check out a previous version of a website that appears in the results. The goal is to streamline access to archived details about a webpage to show how it's evolved, preserve important information, and offer help to researchers, according to a Google spokesperson.

"We know that many people, including those in the research community, value being able to see previous versions of webpages when available," the spokesperson said. 

"That's why we've added links to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to our 'About this page' feature, to give people quick context and make this helpful information easily accessible through Search."

To access archived information about a specific site, click the three dots next to a search result. In the "About this result" panel, click the link "More about this page". That action displays a link to the Wayback Machine page for the given website. Clicking on the link then lets you view previous versions of the page as snapshots into how it appeared at different times in the past.

The collaboration between Google and the Wayback Machine is designed to stress the importance of archiving the web and especially to ease [the way people can explore past content](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-stop-google-from-selling-your-browser-history-for-ad-targeting/), according to The Internet Archive. The link to archived webpages won't be available in cases where the owner or rights holder has opted out of the process or if the page violates content policies.

"The web is aging, and with it, countless URLs now lead to digital ghosts," Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, said in a statement.

"Enter the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: for more than 25 years, it's been preserving snapshots of the public web. This digital time capsule transforms our 'now-only' browsing into a journey through internet history. And now, it's just a click away from Google search results, opening a portal to a fuller, richer web -- one that remembers what others have forgotten."
