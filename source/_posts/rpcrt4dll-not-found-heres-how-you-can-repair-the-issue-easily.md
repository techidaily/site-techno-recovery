## RPCRT4.DLL Not Found? Here's How You Can Repair the Issue Easily
 Rpcrt4.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the rpcrt4[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, rpcrt4.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Rpcrt4.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed to try the more likely fixes first.

 Don't download rpcrt4.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source. If you've already downloaded this DLL file, delete it immediately and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restore rpcrt4.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" rpcrt4.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some rpcrt4.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the rpcrt4.dll file. Since this DLL file is provided by Microsoft,[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) should restore it.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Replacing the rpcrt4.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
4. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The rpcrt4.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the rpcrt4.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that uses the rpcrt4.dll file. If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.
7. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for hardware devices that might be related to rpcrt4.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file rpcrt4.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The rpcrt4.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
8. [Roll back a driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to a previously installed version if rpcrt4.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
9. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause rpcrt4.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
10. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual rpcrt4.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
11. Use a[free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair rpcrt4.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid rpcrt4.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. We've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
12. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the rpcrt4.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the rpcrt4.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
13. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any rpcrt4.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
