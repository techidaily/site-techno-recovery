##  What to Expect From Apple's March Event

 As is always the case with these Apple events, there are tons of rumors leading into it, giving us a decent idea of what to expect. This is good because Apple's [event announcement](https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1499067834411872258?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499067834411872258%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D789632action%3Dedit) tells us next to nothing about what it plans to show, other than mentioning "peek performance."

 Apple is expected to reveal the latest budget-friendly iPhone SE, according to [Bloomberg's Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-04/apple-aims-to-debut-new-low-cost-5g-iphone-ipad-in-early-march). The new iPhone SE is expected to featureÂ 5G, a faster A15 chip, and better cameras, which is pretty standard for new phone models.

 Bloomberg also suggests Apple will announce the latest version of the iPad Air. It will likely have a faster chip and support for [5G](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-flip-to-fun-converting-youtube-videos-to-playful-download-free-gifs-for-2024/) on some models.

 Apple may announce new Mac devices, but we're not as confident on that one. YouTuberÂ Marques Brownlee [mentioned](https://twitter.com/mkbhd/status/1499067562151366664?s=21) [Apple Silicon](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/expert-guide-finding-and-installing-the-right-drivers-for-your-hp-thunderbolt-g2-dock-whether-you-need-120w-or-230w-power-support/) in a tweet, implying that there could be new devices toting Apple's latest chips, but we'll have to wait for the event to find out.

 The company could also announce its next-generation M2 chip, which was alsoÂ [postulated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-02-20/when-will-apple-aapl-launch-a-new-macbook-air-macbook-pro-imac-pro-in-2022-kzvdtgri) by Mark Gurman.

 Regardless of what Apple announces, we'll be tuning in and watching the event to see what the future holds for one tech's biggest movers.
