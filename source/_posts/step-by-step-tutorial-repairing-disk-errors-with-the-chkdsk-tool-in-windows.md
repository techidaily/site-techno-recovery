## Revitalize Your iPad with a New Battery - A Step-by-Step Tutorial
 The iPad's battery is its most important feature. After all, your[iPad won't turn on](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-wont-turn-on-4103788) if it doesn't have power. An iPad's battery generally has a life of a few years, but it will eventually start to hold less power and need to be recharged more often.

 It's not easy to replace the battery in an iPad because Apple designs its products with solid cases that can only be opened with effort and skill. But that doesn't mean you need to[buy a new iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-ipad-models-and-generations-1994232) when the battery starts to die.

 Here are four options for replacing an iPad battery that won’t hold a charge:  

## Battery Replacement for iPads Under Warranty (AppleCare)

 If your iPad is under its original warranty, or you purchased[AppleCare](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-warranty-plus-applecare-1999284) that's still in effect, Apple will replace the battery (actually, the entire iPad) for free. Know, however, that a warranty doesn’t cover batteries that have suffered from normal wear and tear.

 You can[check if your iPad is still under warranty](https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-phone-under-warranty-2000667) by entering your iPhone's serial number into [Apple's warranty checker tool](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/) .  

 If your warranty is still active,[go to Apple's iPad Repair & Service support page](https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair) and select**Get service** . You can also[set up an appointment at an Apple Store](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601) and take your iPad in.

[Back up your iPad data](https://www.lifewire.com/back-up-your-ipad-1999864) before handing over your iPad to avoid losing your data. The repaired or replaced iPad should arrive three to five business days after you give yours to Apple.

 Apple may test your iPad to see if the problem was caused by something not covered by the warranty (if so, your replacement likely won't be free). Also, if the iPad has an engraving on it, the turnaround time can be up to two weeks, since Apple will also engrave the replacement iPad.

 While[we don't recommend buying additional insurance for your devices](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-not-to-buy-iphone-insurance-1999610) , you may have insured your iPad (or have a policy that covers all your tech). If so, check your insurance policy to see if battery replacement is covered.

## Battery Replacement for iPads With Expired Warranty

 If your iPad is out of warranty, Apple will repair the battery for a fee. How much it costs depends on the model; see the iPad Repair & Service page above for an estimate. To initiate a repair, start a service request on Apple's site or go to an Apple Store.

 Even if you have to pay for the battery replacement, it's a decent price to get an iPad working again. That said, you should consider the cost of repair versus the cost of getting a new iPad. If the iPad with the failed battery is old, it may be better to put that money toward the cost of buying a new iPad.

 You can[extend your iPad's battery life](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ipad-battery-life-tips-1999807) by disabling certain features like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use.

## iPad Battery Replacement at Authorized Repair Shops

 Some shops repair iPad screens and batteries. These repair shops may even be found in kiosks in many malls and may charge less than Apple. If you plan to use one of these repair shops, look for one that is authorized by Apple to provide repairs. That means they're trained and experienced. An inexperienced repair person may cause more problems than they solve. Apple may not fix these problems if they were performed by an unauthorized provider.

## DIY iPad Battery Replacement

 It's possible to replace an iPad battery yourself with the right tools and skills. Only try this do-it-yourself option ​if you're tech-savvy and willing to risk destroying your iPad. It will cost between $50 and $90 to buy the tools and parts needed to replace the iPad battery. But remember: Repairing your own iPad voids its warranty (if it's still under warranty). If you ruin your iPad, Apple will not fix it.

 If you're interested in replacing your own iPad battery,[iFixit has a tutorial on replacing an iPad battery](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPad+Wi-Fi+Battery+Replacement/2198) that can help guide you.

 FAQ

* What iPad models are eligible for battery replacement?  
 All iPad models are eligible, but your iPad's battery must be able to hold less than 80 percent of its original capacity to qualify for the out-of-warranty battery service.
* How do I check my iPad battery's health?  
 To[check your iPad battery's health](https://www.lifewire.com/check-battery-health-of-ipad-5114510) , use a third-party iOS battery management app like iMazing or coconutBattery. These apps can assess your iPad battery's current capacity and charge, along with more information.
