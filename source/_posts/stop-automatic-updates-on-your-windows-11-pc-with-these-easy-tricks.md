 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** , type**wifi** and click**Change Wi-Fi settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b320453ed059.jpg)

 Itâ€™s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.

6) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
