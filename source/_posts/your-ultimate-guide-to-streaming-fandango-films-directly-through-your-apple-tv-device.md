## Your Ultimate Guide to Streaming Fandango Films Directly Through Your Apple TV Device

Close 

 This article will show you how to watch movies from your Fandango at Home library on your Apple TV streaming box. Instructions apply to Apple TV 4th generation and newer.

##  How to Start Watching Fandango at Home on Apple TV 

 To get started with Fandango at Home, you first need to[ download it from the App Store](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-apps-on-apple-tv-1999693) . Then, follow the on-screen instructions to sign in.

 Unfortunately, you can't create a new account inside the app, so if you haven't already started using Fandango at Home, you need to create an account on another device such as a laptop, desktop, smartphone, or tablet.

##  How to Rent and Buy Movies on Fandango at Home for Apple TV 

 While you can watch purchased or rented movies or TV shows using the Fandango at Home app, and you have access to the full Movies on Us free movie catalog, you can't rent or purchase movies using the Apple TV Fandango at Home app. You can add to your wishlist, but you'll have to go to the website to make the purchase.

 Apple charges a 30% commission for all in-app purchases, which includes digital media like music, books, and movies. Instead of passing this on to the customer, providers like Fandango at Home and Amazon disallow buying or renting in the app. Instead, you must make purchases on other devices directly from the Fandango at Home website.

 Once you buy or rent a Fandango at Home movie on another device, it should appear on your Apple TV in seconds.
