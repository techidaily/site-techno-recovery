##  How Do I Fix It When IG Stories Won't Upload? 

 If your Instagram stories won't upload, try these steps to fix it.

1. [ Check your internet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/cant-connect-to-the-internet-try-this-817794) . Uploading videos takes a lot of data. Connect to a Wi-Fi network if you have bad reception.
2. Restart the Instagram app. Use the[ app switcher](https://www.lifewire.com/quit-apps-on-iphone-2000287) if you’re on an iPhone.[ For Android users](https://www.lifewire.com/close-apps-on-android-4164116) , long-press the Instagram icon and select**App info** \>**Force stop** .
3. [ Check Instagram for problems](https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/) . Use Downdetector to see if other people are reporting problems with Instagram.
4. [ Delete the story and re-upload it](https://www.lifewire.com/post-a-story-on-instagram-5069910) . Restarting the app should stop glitches that prevent a story from uploading. Save the story if you recorded it live, and then delete the draft and upload it again.
5. Remove gifs and emojis. Gifs and emojis are allowed in stories, but they can cause problems. Post a simple story containing only a photo or video to see if the problem persists.
6. [ Clear your cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-android-4157780) . Your device saves data to decrease loading time, but this data can become corrupted. Delete these files to improve Instagram's performance.  
 Since iPhones delete cache data automatically, this step is more important for Android users.
7. [ Update Instagram.](https://www.lifewire.com/update-instagram-5116640) Software updates can introduce new bugs, but Instagram works quickly to resolve them.
8. [ Update your Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/check-updates-for-android-1616953) . Out-of-data software on your phone may make it incompatible with newer versions of Instagram. If you have an iPhone,[ check for iOS updates](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293) .
9. [ Uninstall and reinstall Instagram.](https://help.instagram.com/370569449686414) This process will ensure you have a fully updated version of the app with no corrupted code.
10. Use your phone’s browser. If the app has a bug, it may not work properly until Instagram updates it again. You can use your phone's browser as a workaround. Go to Instagram.com, and ignore any prompts for you to use the app.
11. Post the story from another device. To see if your phone is causing the problem, post the story from a computer, tablet, or someone else’s phone.  
 This step is more important for Android users. Instagram’s code can’t account for the huge variety of camera software and hardware in Android devices. Users on Reddit have noted frequent problems with Instagram on Android devices.
12. [ Report the issue to Instagram.](https://help.instagram.com/381579045265733?helpref=faq%5Fcontent) If you have ruled out all other possibilities, you can report the problem directly from the Instagram app. Describe the problem in detail, including what steps you took to resolve the problem. If other users report a similar problem, Instagram will resolve it as quickly as possible.

 FAQ
