## Top Recommended Samsung Smart TV Applications - Enhance Your Viewing Experience

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 Our Top Picks

## The Roku Channel

 What We Don't Like

 Roku is well-known for its[streaming sticks, boxes, and smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) , but it also offers a streaming app for other devices, including select Samsung TVs. The Roku Channel provides a mix of free content accessible through a "Netflix-like" onscreen interface for Samsung TVs that includes live news and sports, as well as past hit movies and TV shows.

You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content. You can rent many movies for $4.99, usually with a 48-hour viewing window. Content offerings, some in HDR, change periodically. You need only a 4mbps to 5mbps broadband speed.

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

 Like YouTube and Instagram Video, Facebook Watch lets you watch user-generated videos on your big-screen Samsung TV. The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more.

 What We Like

* No cable or satellite subscription required.

* Low cost if you can live with limited ads on a basic subscription.

 What We Don't Like

* Although cable subscription isn't required, you still have to pay a subscription fee via the app.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .
