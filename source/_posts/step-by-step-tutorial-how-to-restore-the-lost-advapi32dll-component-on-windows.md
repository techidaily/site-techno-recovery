## Step-by-Step Tutorial on Cleaning a Clicker - Keep It Germ-Free
### What to Know

* First, remove your remote's batteries to be safe.
* Use a cloth and some isopropyl alcohol, if possible, though soap and water can work in a pinch.

## How to Clean Your Remote

 Make sure you have a cloth and some isopropyl alcohol handy. Although, soap and warm water can work, too.

 You'll need to be extra careful with water around your electronics, however, and make sure your remote is fully powered off before cleaning and fully dry before you power it back up.

1. First, turn off the TV and remove your remote's batteries, if it uses them.
2. Wet your cloth with some isopropyl alcohol or some soap and warm water. A microfiber cloth is best, but any will do.  
 While alcohol may be more effective, you can use soap and water can be used. If you do, use as little water as possible, and make sure your remote is completely dry before replacing the batteries and using it.
3. Wipe down the remote. Once batteries are removed, you don't have to worry about being too gentle, but don't scrub it too hard..  
 Make sure to give any sticky buttons more attention and be generous with the isopropyl alcohol.  
 If you have a remote where batteries can't be removed, be incredibly careful cleaning with water. If water gets inside a remote like that, you risk damaging the device.
4. Dry your remote. A dry cloth (or dry portion of the cloth you used above) will work nicely, but if you have it, compressed air is an effective way to dry electronic devices.  
 If you were dealing with a sticky button, compressed air is a great way to clear out any water or alcohol that made its way into the deep crevices. Alcohol should evaporate quickly on its own, but it's best to be thorough.
5. Once your remote is completely dry, reinsert the batteries.

## Tips for Keeping TV Remotes Clean

 The biggest thing to avoid with a remote is anything greasy or sugary. Touching a remote after eating can make it oily or cause buttons to stick.

 Of course, the best practice is not to use a remote while eating and to make sure you wash your hands before touching your remote.

 However, since many TVs today have smart functionality, and you can often control them with a smartphone, using your phone to pause whatever you're watching while eating is a smart practice, because[phones are easier to clean than a remote](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-phone-screen-4688907) .

[Unlike a computer](https://www.lifewire.com/clean-your-pc-5074108) or your[keyboard](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-a-computer-keyboard-4842327) , for example, there isn't a certain schedule for how often a remote needs cleaning. If you're careful, it may never need more than a quick wipe on a shirt. If you notice any buttons beginning to stick, or it just feels generally gross to hold, that means it's time for a cleaning.
