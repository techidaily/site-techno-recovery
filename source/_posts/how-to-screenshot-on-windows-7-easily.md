**Windows Defender** is the  antivirus software that are built in Windows 8.1 and 10 on every edition. Just as other antivirus software, it is meant to protect your computer from any possible viruses, spyware or other sorts of malicious code.

 If you don’t have another trusted antivirus program installed or running on your computer, Windows Defender will automatically run since it doesn’t want your system to go unprotected.
  
On some occasions, Windows Defender seems to have trouble turning itself on. In such case, you need to manually turn Windows Defender on so as to avoid any unwanted attacks coming from virus or Trojans.
  
To turn Windows Defender on, you can follow the steps below to get it down easily!
