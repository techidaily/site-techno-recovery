## Top Rated VPN Services for Flawless Streaming: In-Depth Analysis by Tech Experts - ZDNet

Sometimes, you might want to use a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) to access streaming services and stay entertained both at home and abroad.

You can use a VPN server to connect to a new location and access your streaming account to watch films and TV shows. You may also be able to use a VPN to avoid geo-blocks and watch live sports events.

**Also:** [**The best live TV streaming services**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-live-tv-streaming-service/)

Accessing these services is a legal gray area when you aren't in your usual location. Even if you have a legal right to content at home, you may be violating a streaming service's terms and conditions when you are elsewhere or masking your original IP address. That said, streaming services, including [Netflix](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-netflix-vpn/), have acknowledged that subscribers often use VPNs, so at least some content will typically be displayed if a VPN is detected. 

Being able to access streaming services no matter where you are is a key reason many of us invest in a VPN. So, VPN vendors often share how customers can use their services to bypass restrictions, including what streaming services can be unblocked.

### Surfshark

#### Best budget VPN for streaming

Surfshark is one of the cheapest VPNs on our list, offering a solid product at an excellent price.

In our [Surfshark VPN review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/), we found no DNS leaks, and the service has a strong security focus -- although, sometimes, speeds can be marginally lower than when using other VPNs. 

If you're looking for a VPN suitable for [Amazon's Fire TV stick](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.surfshark.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360018591494-How-to-set-up-Surfshark-on-Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3Dconnection%2520was%2520successful-%2CInstall%2520the%2520app%2CSearch%2520for%2520%2522Surfshark%2522.%26text%3DClick%2520on%2520the%2520Get%2520button%2Capp%2520will%2520be%2520automatically%2520installed.) or [Android TV](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fdownload%2Fandroid-tv-vpn%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DWill%2520a%2520VPN%2520work%2520on%2Con%2520the%2520Google%2520Play%2520Store.), this VPN is for you.

**Also:** [**ExpressVPN vs. Surfshark vs. NordVPN: Which is best?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-vs-surfshark-vs-nordvpn-which-vpn-service-is-best/)

Surfshark should work with the most popular streaming [services](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.surfshark.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Fsections%2F4417084270994-Streaming), such as Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, DAZN, and Disney+. The company attempts to disguise your VPN traffic as regular traffic to circumvent geolocation blockers.

Remember that if you're having trouble streaming, you may need to try a different server or country location. Streaming services sometimes block IPs specifically connected to a VPN, so switching locations can remove these barriers.

Surfshark is also one of our top choices for affordability. Customers applaud Surfshark customer service, but some have had billing issues.

Surfshark's VPN starts at $2.19 per month for a two-year subscription plan (three months free) and $2.99 per month for a one-year subscription. Alternatively, you can sign up for one month with plans starting at $15.45.

**Review:** [**IPVanish**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review-a-rich-wealth-of-options-and-surfing-controls/)

IPVanish had fast connection speeds in recent tests. That said, download speeds sometimes lag behind other VPNs, so you may struggle with high-resolution streaming, and IPVanish's streaming capabilities can be slightly more limited than those of other top VPNs.

IPVanish's plans start at $2.19 per month for a two-year subscription and rise to $2.79 per month for a year of access. A one-month subscription costs $12.99 per month.

#### Best VPN for money-back guarantee

CyberGhost is another excellent option if you need a VPN for streaming -- especially if you want one with great multi-platform compatibility.

CyberGhost provides strong streaming capabilities and reliable speeds across services including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and Max. During our testing, we had some trouble with the anime streaming service Crunchyroll on Windows, but going Incognito fixed the problem.

The speeds were strong, although they were not the best we've encountered. 

**Review: [CyberGhost VPN: A solid VPN for beginners](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyberghost-vpn-review/)**

Another benefit is CyberGhost's 45-day money-back guarantee, which is the longest our recommended VPNs offer. So, if you need to try out a streaming VPN for more than a month to decide, this VPN is for you. Customers like how easy the VPN is to use, although they would like to see improved obfuscation.

CyberGhost's two-year plan will cost you $2.19 per month, including two months of free access. A six-month plan is priced at $6.99 per month, whereas a month of access will cost you $12.99.

****CyberGhost VPN features: Native Streaming Apps:** Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV | **Simultaneous Connections:** 7 | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Linux | **Logging:** No activity logs | **Servers:** 10,000+ | **Locations:** 100+ | **Money-back guarantee:** 45 days | **Trial**: 24 hours on PC, three days on Android, and seven days on iOS

## Factors to consider when choosing a streaming VPN

When you are deciding on the most suitable streaming VPN for you, you should consider the following factors:

* **Price**: VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars. Keep an eye on renewal rates, as some VPN providers hike prices after introductory periods.
* **Usage length**: You need to consider your preferred price point regarding how long you think you will need a VPN. If you're in it for the long haul, consider a two-year subscription, as you also tend to earn the best prices with the most extended terms. Some VPNs will offer longer options.
* **Streaming** **availability**: Many VPN providers transparently publish which streaming services work through their connections. Some of the most popular streaming services -- such as Netflix and Disney+ -- will typically work on most, although you may not have access to all geo-locked content libraries.
* **Native apps**: If you want to access your streaming service on a specific platform or OS, find out what native apps are available. For example, some VPN providers have developed native apps for tvOS that are suitable for use with Apple TV.
* **Security**: Consider the VPN's security track record. Preferably, the VPN will be open to external audits, and they won't suffer any significant recent data breaches. You also want a VPN provider that transparently and regularly improves its security posture.
* **Routers**: Some VPNs may not provide native apps for your preferred streaming service. If this is the case, you might need to install your VPN directly on your router.

## How we test VPNs

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been reviewing VPNs for years, and have spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression if we've included them on this list.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure. Once you choose a VPN, it's essential that you test for all your likely usage profiles and only then decide whether to keep the service or request a money-back guaranteed refund.

These VPNs also have solid money-back guarantees, and we would not have recommended them otherwise. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for streaming TV and movies below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming content if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well considering these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming, although we can't guarantee that every VPN will consistently work with every streaming service. We also tested access to geo-locked libraries, although we don't suggest you should.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive apps suitable for various hardware.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days.

## How to use a VPN with a streaming service

Getty/NurPhoto

Since many streaming services restrict access to content in different geographic regions, using a virtual private network can allow you to unblock streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu -- simply by changing your IP address and appearing as if you are in a different region. Change your location, and you can access the libraries tied to your chosen region.

In general, here are the steps for using most VPNs with your preferred streaming service:

1. **Choose a VPN provider.** You must choose one with servers in the region where the streaming service you want to access is available. Our list above has some great options.
2. **Download and install the VPN software.** Follow the instructions provided by the VPN provider to get the VPN up and running on your device.
3. **Connect to a server.** Once you have installed the VPN, open it and follow the on-screen instructions to choose a server. Pick one in the region where the streaming service you want to access is available.
4. **Log in to the streaming service.** After connecting to a server, log in to the streaming service. It should now see you as located in the region of the VPN server you connected to -- thus allowing you to access any content in that region (which would normally be unavailable if you don't live there).
5. **Start streaming.** Voilà! Easy right?

Keep in mind that using a VPN to unblock content restricted in your region may violate the streaming service's terms of service. Also, some VPNs do not work with all streaming services, and access can change at any time.

## Do you need a VPN for streaming?

A VPN is not required for streaming movies, games, or TV shows. By chaning your location, howeveer, you can unlock certain services or products in other countries. The tradeoff is that a VPN will likely slow down your connection -- especially if you opt for a free plan -- because the distance to the server, encryption process, and protocol can introduce lag.

If you find that streaming with a VPN is unbearably slow, try connecting to a different server or a different VPN service altogether. Lag can often be minimized with better VPN services.

Many free VPNs will prevent you from streaming altogether or have a strict data usage limit. 

## How do VPNs work with cable and other streaming products?

VPNs, set-top boxes, and streaming sticks don't always work well together. You might have to set up your router to distribute a VPN to all your devices for blanket coverage or connect your TV as a client to your PC and use that machine's VPN-protected network. If you want to stream TV through a VPN, picking up a VPN-supporting device such as a Fire TV stick or a [router with a VPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/) enabled is one of the easiest pathways.

## Do VPNs work with smart TVs for streaming?

Yes, although depending on your TV model and any other hardware you have on hand -- such as an Amazon Fire TV stick -- the way you install and use a VPN can differ. For example, a Samsung TV might not have a native VPN app available, but you could install the same VPN on your Fire Stick and access streaming services through it. Alternatively, you could install a VPN on your router to give all of your devices blanket coverage.

## What set-top devices have native VPN apps?

Android TV is a variant of Android, as you might have guessed. That means most apps in the Google Play Store, including VPN clients, will run reasonably well on Android TV. Most VPN vendors slightly change their Android handheld apps to have a wide-screen UI for TVs and put those apps into the Play Store.

Since Amazon's Fire TV could best be described as a skinned version of Android TV with Amazon's app store, VPN vendors don't have to do too much technically to make their apps work there too. Just go to Amazon's app store and install the VPN app you want. 

In 2023, Apple introduced third-party support for VPNs on Apple TV. Some VPN providers are developing native apps, but others, including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark, have already released them.

Unfortunately, there aren't native VPN apps available for all streaming devices. You can still use a VPN, but you'll need to set it up on your router or PC network. The same process applies if you want to stream via an Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch.

## Can I watch Netflix with a VPN?

Yes. In fact, this popular streaming service is the reason many people use a VPN. Netflix appears to have accepted widespread VPN use among its subscribers, so instead of blocking connections outright -- which was often a problem in the past -- the streaming service allows access to its library of globally-licensed content when a VPN is detected. Sometimes, it can also be possible to access regional content, although watching this content may be against Netflix's terms of service. 

## Will a VPN slow down your streaming speed?

It's possible that using a VPN could slow down your streaming speed, but this depends on a variety of factors such as the quality of your VPN, the location of the server you're connected to, and your internet connection speed.

If you experience traffic slowdowns, check not only your VPN but also your Wi-Fi connection between your device and your router or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops.

## Does a VPN hide what you stream?

A VPN encrypts your online traffic, masks your online activity, and gives you a different IP address. These services can prevent internet service providers from knowing when you are streaming, which in turn can prevent them from throttling your speed. A VPN shouldn't reveal what you are streaming, but this doesn't mean it won't be logged in your account by your streaming service. 

## What is the best free VPN for streaming?

We don't typically recommend using a free VPN if you are constantly streaming content, as this can eat up your bandwidth, and free VPN plans will often come with restrictions, including available speeds and country server availability. If you want to try out a VPN for streaming before you commit to a paid plan, consider Proton VPN or Windscribe.
