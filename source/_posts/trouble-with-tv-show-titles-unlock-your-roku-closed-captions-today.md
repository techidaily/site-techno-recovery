## How to Fix Msvbvm50.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download msvbvm50.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many[reasons why downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore msvbvm50.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" msvbvm50.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . This is smart only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did so.  
 Start Windows in Safe Mode to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the msvbvm50.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the msvbvm50.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the msvbvm50.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Download msvbvm50.dll from Microsoft](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/msvbvm50dll-was-not-found/ca0cdcd8-27d8-4498-924e-70e258bdff28) if reinstalling the program doesn't do any good. After you've downloaded msvbvm50.exe (Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0), double-click or double-tap the[EXE](https://www.lifewire.com/exe-file-2622732) file to install the DLL file to the correct place.  
 However, if that doesn't work, or you need to put the DLL file in a specific folder like an application's folder, use a[free file extractor](https://www.lifewire.com/free-unzip-programs-1356643) to extract the contents of the EXE file.  
 There should be 11 files extracted from msvbvm50.exe. Most of them are DLL files, but you're looking for the one called MSVBVM50.DLL.

![msvbvm50 extracted files with the DLL selected](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P9u78l4cNAf7FrD-WGPkZl6tdyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/msvbvm50-dll-file-c80ea260b2174d1dacc0564a6a2c3c46.png)  
 It's always best to get it from the original source, which in this case is Microsoft. Do not download the msvbvm50.dll file from any other website.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some msvbvm50.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the msvbvm50.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the msvbvm50.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration, a System Restore could solve the problem.
6. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to msvbvm50.dll. If, for example, you see a_msvbvm50.dll is missing_ error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .
7. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if msvbvm50.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Run the sfc/scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the msvbvm50.dll file. In some versions of Windows, this DLL file is provided by Microsoft, so the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) tool should restore it.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The msvbvm50.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and hard drive are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause msvbvm50.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual msvbvm50.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. Use a[free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair msvbvm50.dll related issues in[Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) . A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid msvbvm50.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might prompt the DLL error.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the msvbvm50.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make the best attempt possible to fix the msvbvm50.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any msvbvm50.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Msvbvm50.dll Error Messages

 In some cases, msvbvm50.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware problem, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure. However, it typically arises from the file becoming corrupt or being deleted.
