 Rumors suggest the Apple Watch X might sport a slimmer case and introduce a novel method for band attachment, potentially positioning it as one of the[ most attractive smartwatches](https://www.lifewire.com/best-looking-smart-watches-3441410) of the year. Here's everything we know about when the 10th-generation Apple Watch will arrive, how much it'll cost, and more.

##  When Will Apple Watch X Be Released? 

 A new Apple Watch comes out every year. Following the[ Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-series-9-news-andrumors-7485156) , it makes sense that the 2024 smartwatch will be called the Apple Watch Series 10\. However, Apple could mark the 10th anniversary of their smartwatch with different branding as they did with the[ iPhone X](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-x-4150706) .

 Whether it's called the Apple Watch Series X or Series 10, a refresh is coming. There are several[ Apple events](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-event-5097169) throughout the year, but it'll undoubtedly be the September event that will unveil the next smartwatch.

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 We think the Apple Watch X release date will be either September 20 or September 27\. It should launch alongside the[ iPhone 16](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-16-news-and-rumors-7111749) .

## Apple Watch X Price Rumors 

 There have been two case sizes for the Apple Watch in past years, and we expect that to continue this year. The Apple Watch X lineup should cost the same as last year's watches:

* Apple Watch Series X (41mm): $399
* Apple Watch Series X (45mm): $429

 If you want cellular connectivity, expect to pay an additional $100\. Case materials different than aluminum, like stainless steel and titanium, will also cost extra.

## Pre-Order Information 

 Apple hasn't announced this watch yet, but when they do we'll drop the Apple Watch X pre-order link here.

## Apple Watch X Features 

 In his March 2024 newsletter, Mark Gurman reported that "all signs point to the new Apple Watch gaining a blood-pressure checker this fall." He adds that[ this feature will probably be exclusive to this watch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt) and won't be available for current models.

 Gurman also says a new health feature "designed to take the smartwatch to new heights" is coming to the next Apple Watch:[ sleep apnea detection](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=443980ea-db54-11ee-9342-ad6475737caf&url=L25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMy0xMi0xNy9hcHBsZS0yMDI0LXBsYW5zLW5ldy1sb3ctZW5kLWFpcnBvZHMtdmlzaW9uLXByby1sYXJnZXItaXBob25lLTE2LW9sZWQtaXBhZC1scTlqaGVkNA==) . Much like the existing health-related functions, like the heart rate monitor, you'll be alerted if the watch suspects you have this condition.

 Every new Apple Watch features the latest version of watchOS.[ watchOS 11](https://www.lifewire.com/watchos-11-8552217) will power the Apple Watch X. It's poised to introduce some cool AI features, including a smarter version of Siri.

##  Apple Watch X Specs and Hardware 

 If the rumors about the Apple Watch Series X prove true, they suggest the 2024 Apple Watch is undergoing substantial upgrades this year.[ Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=44629e2e-db54-11ee-b5c8-949810984427&url=L25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMy0wOC0xMy9hcHBsZS1ldmVudC1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMTItMjAyMy1hcHBsZS13YXRjaC1zZXJpZXMtOS11bHRyYS0yLXdhdGNoLXgtbGF0ZXItbGw5Z2ViM24=) the Watch X model "promises to be the biggest overhaul yet."

 One change Gurman mentions is a thinner case. It sounds great, but it does raise some concerns. Which internal hardware would need to be downsized? Will performance and battery life suffer in exchange for a thinner watch?

 That's unlikely. Instead, one solution that could minimize the impact on existing hardware is to switch up another part of the watch. The mechanism for attaching bands, according to Gurman, might change over to a magnetic system. While this would make all your old watchbands useless for the Watch X, it could increase available space inside the watch, which means the case could be thinner without much or any impact on its internal components.

 Some people, like Apple leaker Kosutami, are so confident about this new design that they[ recommend people sell their old bands](https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1737412779307671870) . We don't recommend that.

 These are, of course, just ideas. There hasn't been an Apple Watch Series X announcement yet, so we'll need to wait for that to confirm anything. Even so, we've been hearing about a smaller Digital Crown in the[ Apple Watch Ultra 3](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-ultra-3-8575877) , so it's reasonable to assume that Gurman's sources are correct about similar changes expected for this Apple Watch.

 We've also heard that the bezels on this watch could be made slimmer, which means there could be more space for a bigger screen without making the watch bulkier on your wrist. In one of Mark Gurman's recent_Power On_ newsletters,[ he writes that both Series 10 models will get bigger screens](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q) . And don't worry, the classic rounded, square design isn't going anywhere.

 Gurman also mentions a new chip for the Apple Watch Series 10\. However, the report claims that this watch is unlikely to run[ Apple Intelligence](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-gpt-7571221) because that's been reserved for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. For now, at least.

 Finish options like Pink, Midnight, and Silver will probably stick around, but we won't be surprised to see a new option just for this 10th anniversary.  

 There's still a lot of time for leaks and rumors to pour in before the September Apple event. We'll update this section as we learn more.
