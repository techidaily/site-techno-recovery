## Step-by-Step Solution: Restarting and Repairing Your Zoom Camera Malfunction
 If your camera is not working in Zoom, you can still participate in meetings with just your microphone. However, it's always better to chat face-to-face, so it's worth the effort to fix your Zoom webcam.

 Instructions in this article apply to the Zoom software when it's used on a computer or a mobile device.

## Causes of Zoom Camera Not Working

 If Zoom is not detecting your camera, it could be due to a few reasons:

* Your camera is disabled in Zoom or your device's settings.
* Another app is trying to use the camera at the same time.
* The app needs to be updated to address a camera bug.
* The[device drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) are missing or outdated.
* Problems with your camera's hardware.

 Some[Lenovo PCs have known compatibility issues with Zoom](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm%5Fkb&sysparm%5Farticle=KB0064277) , which require a specific fix. Zoom also has compatibility issues with macOS 10.7.

 In a hurry? You can still join a Zoom call without your camera. And if the app doesn't open at all, another option is to[join a meeting by phone](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm%5Fkb&sysparm%5Farticle=KB0060564) .

## How to Fix Zoom Webcam Not Working

 Follow these steps in the order we've provided them here to get your camera working in Zoom. After each step,[test your camera](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm%5Fkb&sysparm%5Farticle=KB0061836) to make sure it works before you join your next meeting.

1. Confirm that your camera is selected in Zoom. During a meeting, select the**up** **arrow** next to the**camera** icon and make sure the desired webcam is chosen.  
 Also, if the camera icon has a line through it in your Zoom window, select the icon to enable your camera.  
 In the program's settings, in the**Video** tab, there is an option that controls whether your camera turns on when you join meetings. Untick that box to make sure your camera turns on automatically.
2. [Make sure your camera is connected and turned on](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-a-camera-to-a-computer-493809) . If you use an external webcam for Zoom, check the connecting cable for damage, and try connecting it to a different[USB port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166) if possible. For wireless webcams, check your[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) settings and make sure the device's battery is charged.  
Some external webcams also have a physical on/off switch.
3. Close other programs that can access your camera. Other software could be competing with Zoom for your webcam.
4. Check your app permissions. Regardless of the platform you're on, Zoom is an app that needs permission to use your camera.  
 How you give Zoom access to your camera differs between devices: Windows \[[Activate Your Camera on Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/activate-webcam-5185212) \], macOS \[[Turn on the Camera on Your Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436) \], Android \[[Manage Android App Permissions](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-manage-android-app-permissions-4797758) \], and Chrome \[[Give Chrome Camera Access](https://www.lifewire.com/configure-camera-microphone-setting-in-google-chrome-4103623) \].  
 If you're on an iPhone, go to**Settings** \>**Zoom** and confirm that the**Camera** toggle is switched on.
5. Check for a Zoom update. There could be a bug fix waiting to be installed that will fix your webcam not working.  
 Updating Zoom is easy on all platforms: Windows and macOS \[[Update Zoom on Your Desktop](https://www.lifewire.com/update-zoom-on-desktop-computer-5213607) \], Android \[[Update Android Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) \], and iOS \[[Update iPhone Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-keep-iphone-apps-to-date-2000645) \].
6. [Check your device settings](https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-device-settings-4138532) . If you have webcam software on your computer, open it and look through the options for a setting that might have disabled the camera.
7. Some Lenovo PCs have a default feature that prevents Zoom from accessing the camera. On Windows 11/10,[download Lenovo Vantage](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fsolutions%2Fht505081) and use it to[disable the Camera Privacy Mode](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fsolutions%2Fht500417) .  
 If you're having trouble with the Zoom camera on a Windows 7 Lenovo machine, open the**Lenovo Web Conferencing** program and select**Enable your laptop webcam** .
8. [Update your device's drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Windows users might need to install a new driver for the webcam before it'll work.  
 If Zoom is the only app having problems using your camera, you can skip this step. Conversely,[follow this guide to fix your webcam](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-it-when-webcam-is-not-working-4588517) if your other apps also can't access it; you might need to[get a new webcam](https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-a-webcam-2640480) if it's a hardware issue.
9. [Restart your device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . A[reboot fixes most computer problems](https://www.lifewire.com/why-does-restarting-seem-to-fix-most-computer-problems-2624569) because it closes any ongoing processes that could be interfering with software or hardware, such as your camera.
10. [Update your Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/update-macos-macbook-pro-4178508) . If you're on a Mac running macOS 10.7, upgrade to a newer version of the macOS operating system.  
 If you can't update your Mac for whatever reason,[follow Zoom's other solution for this problem](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm%5Fkb&sysparm%5Farticle=KB0064336) .
11. Change Zoom's advanced video settings. Zoom provides tools designed to enhance video playback, but they sometimes have the opposite result. If your video continues to be distorted, open Zoom's settings to the**Video** tab and select**Advanced** to adjust these options.
12. Reinstall Zoom. You can get the latest version from the app store on your phone or via the[Zoom website](https://zoom.com/) .
