## Android Tips & Tricks: How to Ensure No More Running Applications Eat Up Resources
### What to Know

* Go to**Settings** \>**Apps** , select the app from the list, and tap**App battery usage** .
* Then, tap**Force stop** to shut it down, or switch off**Allow background usage** to prevent background activity.
* To see apps running in the background, go to**Settings** \>**System** \>**Developer options** \>**Running services** .

 This article explains how to stop apps from running in the background on Android 9 and higher.

## Stop Android Apps From Running in the Background

 Here's how to kill background apps on Android:

 The Settings interface may differ depending on your phone's manufacturer and your version of Android, but the same options should be available.

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Apps** .
2. Select an app you want to stop, then tap**Force stop** .

 If you don't use the app, this is a good time to just uninstall it. Tap**Uninstall** to remove the app from your device.
3. Tap**OK** on the confirmation prompt.  
 This will clear battery or memory issues only until you restart your phone. Any apps that launch on startup will restart and could cause the same problems.  
 The app will relaunch when you restart your phone. To turn off all background activity for the app, select**App battery usage** and then tap the**Allow background usage** toggle to turn it off.

## How Background Apps Affect Your Android Battery

 Your Android device can run multiple apps in the background for several reasons. Most of the time, it won't cause battery problems or constrain the phone's memory. One factor causing your Android device's battery to drain too quickly is when there are too many apps running.

 You can see the apps running in the background by tapping the square**Overview navigation icon** at the lower-right corner of your Android display.

 Google Pixel phones use swipe navigation by default. To[set up 3-button navigation on a Google Pixel](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-buttons-on-pixel-6-5213414) , go to**Settings** \>**System** \>**Navigation mode** .

 Remember, multiple windows may open inside some apps, like multiple tabs inside the Google Chrome mobile browser. Each of these could potentially consume resources that use up the battery.

 There are many[poorly written apps on Google Play](https://www.lifewire.com/is-google-play-safe-153675) , and when you install those on your phone, they may consume more battery power, CPU, or memory than they're supposed to. Auditing your installed apps (mentioned above) is good phone hygiene.

 FAQ

* How do you switch between apps on Android?  
 Swipe up from the bottom of your phone's screen, keeping holding for a moment, and then let go. Swipe left or right to find the app you want. Once you see it, tap it to bring it to the front.
* How do I stop Android from optimizing apps?  
 If you don't use an app for a while, Android will sometimes remove an app's permission which can be a headache later. If you don't want Android to do that, go to**App Info** and turn off the**Pause app activity if unused** switch.
