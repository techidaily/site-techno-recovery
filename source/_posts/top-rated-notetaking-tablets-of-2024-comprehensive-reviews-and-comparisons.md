## Top Notetakers 2024: Comprehensive Testing & Reviews by Tech Expert

Tablets can do so many different things, but one of their go-to uses is taking notes. These devices make it easier than ever for students or professionals to jot down everything they need while being portable and even powerful enough to replace a heftier laptop. 

Tablets run the gamut in terms of everything they can do (and all the prices they show up at), so even if you're looking for a tablet to take notes in classes or meetings, it's essential to consider what else you might want to use it for. For students returning to school (or heading off to college in the fall), you might get a tablet instead of a laptop, while professionals might carry one for commuting purposes since they are much more portable. There are note-taking tablets on the market that fit both of those scenarios.

## Apple iPad Air (5th generation)

### Best note-taking tablet overall

Even Android fans will like Apple's iPad Air. The lightweight tablet can do everything -- including taking notes. Compatible with the Apple Pencil (second generation), the iPad Air makes it easy to take notes in class or meetings and watch seminars virtually if needed. Apple's products are largely customizable, and this is no different: you can opt for one of five colors and get more or less storage depending on what you need. 

In addition, you can also equip your iPad to use cellular data if Wi-Fi doesn't feel sufficient for classes or commuting. For students or professionals who might need to use their tablets while on the go often, a cellular data plan ensures you can always get online to access. 

**Review:** [**Apple iPad Air (5th generation)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-ipad-air-fifth-generation-review/)

ZDNET contributor, Jason Cipriani, went hands-on with the iPad Air and was impressed by its 2-in-1 compatibility thanks to the Apple Keyboard and Apple Pencil additions. "It's as powerful as the iPad Pro, but costs hundreds of dollars less -- even when you max out the storage -- with a display that's on par with the 11-inch iPad Pro," he wrote. 

Overall, 98% of Best Buy customers who bought the iPad Air would recommend it to others and gave it an overall rating of 4.8 out of 5.

**iPad Air** **(5th generation)** **tech specs: Display**: 10.9-inch Retina display | **Processor**: Apple Silicon M1 | **Storage**: 64GB or 256GB | **Biometrics**: Touch ID | **Colors**: Space gray, starlight, pink, purple, blue | **Cameras**: 12MP rear, 4K video. 12MP Ultra Wide camera | **Weight**: 1.02 pounds | **Dimensions**: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches | **Connections**: USB-C port | **Battery life:** 10 hours

## Boox Note Air 3 C

### Best lightweight note-taking tablet

The Boox Note Air 3 C is a color e-ink tablet that is built for note-taking. The screen has a color 1240 x 930 (150 PPI) resolution and a 2480 x 1860 (300 PPI -- the same as the Kindle Scribe) resolution in black and white. Plus, it's super lightweight at just under a pound. 

I went hands-on with the Boox Note Air 3 C, and it got me out of my productivity slump I had been having. I found my creativity creeping back by using the included stylus, which has virtually no lag, has 4,096 pressure levels, and feels as smooth as your favorite ballpoint pen on a smooth pad of paper.

**Review:** **[The best E Ink tablet I've tested is not by ReMarkable or Kindle](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-e-ink-tablet-ive-tested-is-not-by-remarkable-or-kindle/)**

This tablet has all the best features of the top note-taking apps built right in: there are dozens of templates to use, audio recording, color-coding, inserting links and attachments to notes, and more. Plus, built-in artificial intelligence allows for text recognition, shape perfection, and a strike-through erase feature that makes erasing much easier.

Plus, it has several features that make it a productivity machine. For example, there is a split-screen feature that allows you to switch between two different apps. And, verified customers like the BOOXdrop feature, which allows you to easily send files to the tablet from your computer or smartphone to the tablet. It takes mere seconds, and you can annotate PDFs and other Word documents with ease. 

**Boox Note Air 3 C tech specs: Display**: 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display | **Processor**: 2.4Ghz octa-core + BSR | **Storage**: 64GB | **Memory**: 4GB | **Colors**: Black | **Weight**: 0.95 pounds | **Dimensions**: 8.9 x 7.6 x 0.23 inches | **Connections**: Wi-Fi (2.4GHz + 5GHz) + BT 5.0 | **Battery life:** 3,700mAh Li-ion Polymer

### Best note-taking tablet for reading

The Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of part e-reader, part tablet. It has the same functions you've come to know and love in a Kindle, like a 300 ppi glare-free screen, weeks of battery life, and adjustable warm light. It's also compatible with Amazon's Basic or Premium Pen, so you can take handwritten notes or underline important quotations within the book you're reading. 

Your notes are automatically organized in one place for every book so that you can browse, review, and export them via email. The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents. 

**Review: [Amazon Kindle Scribe](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-kindle-scribe-review/)**

The Kindle Scribe comes with the Basic pen, but verified Amazon customers say it's best to opt for the $30 premium pen so you get more advanced features like a dedicated eraser and the shortcut button.

ZDNET contributor, Matthew Miller, called this 2-in-1 tablet "close to perfect" in his hands-on review. "A key function is how I can quickly and easily erase my handwritten notes by 'brushing' the eraser portion of the . It's an optional accessory for the Scribe, but one that I highly recommend picking up if you want the full note-taking experience," Miller advises. 

**Kindle Scribe** **tech specs: Display:** 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display | **Storage:** 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB | **Weight:** 0.96 pounds | **Dimensions:** 7.7 x 9.0 x 0.22 inches | **Battery life:** Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day)

### Best note-taking tablet for Android users

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is part of Samsung's latest tablet series released this year. The Tab S9 comes with 8GB or 12GB of memory and starts at 128GB of storage, which can be expanded by up to 1TB thanks to microSD card support. Inside the Tab S9 is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. 

The 11-inch LCD is compact enough to make the tablet portable. But most importantly, included in the box with the S9 is an S Pen that you can use to write or draw in your favorite apps, just like you can with the Samsung Galaxy Note lineup.

**Review:** [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-plus-review/)

Miller also tested this base Tab S9 model, saying it was an enjoyable experience, including the new and improved S Pen that has an IP68 waterproof rating and a 2.9ms latency. "Samsung clearly beats Apple by including the S Pen with the tablet, and I love using the Samsung Notes app that includes support for syncing flawlessly with OneNote. It's hard to beat a Samsung tablet when it comes to taking notes, and I stand by that," he wrote. 

[Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyTab/comments/16agpmn/tab%5Fs8%5For%5Ftab%5Fs9%5For%5Ftab%5Fs9%5Ffor%5Fnotetaking%5Fonly/) also note that the Samsung Notes app is "heaven" for note-taking.

## Which note-taking tablet is right for you?

Choosing a tablet really comes down to what you want to use it for and what you want to spend. Basic tablets tend to be cheaper, so if you don't plan to use them for much other than taking notes, you can look at spending a little less and getting something like an Amazon Fire Tablet. 

However, if you want a tablet you can use for school and for everyday things like streaming, photo editing, and more, something like an iPad might be a better choice. 

| **Choose this note-taking tablet...** | **If you want...**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apple iPad Air                        | The best overall option. It's as powerful as the iPad Pro but much lighter and less expensive.                                       |
| Boox Note Air 3 C                     | A lightweight note-taking tablet. It comes with dozens of templates to choose from and useful note-taking and productivity features. |
| Amazon Kindle Scribe                  | A tablet and e-reader in one. You can make notes within the book(s) you are reading, as well as through apps like Microsoft Word.    |
| Samsung Galaxy Tab S9                 | An Android tablet for note-taking. An S Pen is included in the box.                                                                  |
| Amazon Fire Max 11                    | A budget-friendly tablet for under $350\. It is compatible with the Amazon Stylus pen, and you can also attach a keyboard to it.     |

## Factors to consider when choosing the best note-taking tablet

Before you buy a note-taking tablet, you'll want to consider the following:

* **Display:** A tablet's experience is largely based on its display, so pay attention to tablets with HD resolutions and even paper-like displays.
* **Stylus compatibility:** Most people use a stylus when taking notes on a tablet, so consider tablets that either come with a stylus right out of the box or have the option to buy one from the maker separately. It's important to note most universal styluses will also work with these tablets.
* **Size:** Tablets that you will mainly use for note-taking purposes will have different requirements than tablets you need to replace a laptop with. Smaller size tablets are best for note-taking purposes and are lightweight and portable.

## How we test tablets

The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when [tested in the real world](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/). When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.

* **Display**: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.  
We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.
* **Performance:** For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.
* **Battery life**: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.
* **Camera and audio:** For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.

For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive [tablet testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/). 

## Do I need a stylus for a note-taking tablet?

Using a stylus is totally up to you, but it can definitely help with functionality. Some tablets come with a stylus, while others will have them sold separately. If you're looking at this from a cost perspective, consider the fact that the stylus will often be an added expense, but you may find it worth it for ease of use, especially if you're the type that likes the feeling of writing out your notes rather than typing them.

## What are the best note-taking apps?

The [best note-taking apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-note-taking-app-for-ipad/) let you digitize your notes and to-dos while keeping them all in one place or syncing them to a cloud. Our favorites are Notability, Evernote, GoodNotes 5, and even Apple's free Notes app is a worthy choice.

## Does the Apple Pencil convert handwriting to text?

Yes--the Apple Pencil can convert your handwritten notes into text for better legibility. Here's how: 

1. In the Notes or Freeform apps, tap to show the tool palette.
2. In the tool palette, tap the Handwriting tool (to the left of the pen).
3. Write with Apple Pencil, and Scribble automatically converts your handwriting into typed text.

## Other note-taking tablets we've tested:

If none of the above caught your eye or don't seem quite like what you're looking for, there are some similar models at different price points that will also serve you well in taking notes at school or at work.
