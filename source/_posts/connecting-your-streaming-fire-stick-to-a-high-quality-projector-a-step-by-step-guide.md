##  How to Use a Fire Stick With a Projector

 In most cases, you can connect and use a Fire Stick with a projector in the exact same way you would use a Fire Stick with a television. There are a few potential issues, but it’s often just a matter of connecting the Fire Stick, adjusting the projector settings, and then streaming movies, shows, and other content in the same way you would if you were using the Fire Stick with a TV.

 If your projector has an HDMI input, then it will probably work with your Fire Stick without any additional adapters. You may need to use an extension cable if there isn’t a lot of space on the back of the projector, or if your projector sits in a housing that blocks the connection of your Fire Stick to its remote.

 Some projectors don’t have HDMI ports, but you can still use many of these projectors with a Fire Stick. You will need to[ identify the type of audio and video connectors](https://www.lifewire.com/home-theater-surround-sound-av-receiver-4064126) you have, and obtain an adapter that converts from HDMI to appropriate type of input.

 Here are the three most common projector inputs:

* **HDMI** : This is a long, thin port that matches the output connector on your Fire Stick. If there’s enough space, you can plug a Fire Stick directly into this port.
* **RCA** : These are circular ports, and there will typically be two for audio and one for video. If the projector has component video inputs, there will be three RCA ports for video and two for audio.
* **VGA** : This is an older connector that used to be found on computer monitors. It’s shaped like a trapezoid with rounded edges and has 15 small holes.

##  How to Connect a Fire Stick to a Projector

 If your projector has an HDMI port that doesn’t already have anything else plugged in, then connecting a Fire Stick is fairly straightforward.

 Do you use a[ home theater receiver](https://www.lifewire.com/home-theater-receivers-surround-sound-1846348) to handle audio and video in a surround sound system? Follow these instructions, but connect the Fire Stick to an input on the receiver and then connect an output from the receiver to an input on the projector just like you would with a TV.

 Here’s how to connect a Fire Stick to a projector:  

1. Connect your Fire Stick to a USB power source.  
![A Fire Stick plugged into a USB power source.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Bhg-_UuLPgNUTLUiFmLb-HNFc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1-e07db75290a54b5f8b650c7aef7f0509.jpg)  
    
 Use the power adapter you normally use. Don’t connect it to a USB port on your projector even if that seems more convenient.
2. Examine the back of your projector, paying attention to the type of ports it has, and the available space.

3. If there is a space issue, connect your Fire Stick to an HDMI extension cable.

4. Plug your Fire Stick or extension cable into an HDMI input port on your projector.

##  How Do I Connect My Fire Stick to My Projector Without HDMI?

 If your projector doesn’t have an HDMI input port and you’re trying to use the Fire Stick with the projector directly, without a home theater receiver acting as a middle man, you will need an adapter. Look for an adapter that takes an HDMI input and converts it to the appropriate output for your receiver, which will typically be composite video, component video, or[ VGA](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-vga-2626027) .

 The HDMI adapter you use will need to be powered, not passive, and you may also need to use a powered HDMI splitter between the Fire Stick and the adapter if your projector shows only a black screen when connected to the Fire Stick.

 Here’s how to connect a Fire Stick to a projector without HDMI:  

1. Connect your Fire Stick to a USB power source.  
![A Fire TV Stick connected to a USB power source.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VEgreTO-VaLnL5yVbGZbp1011Yc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/a1-cf62f6b5468b4b39acf90318c148d73c.jpg)
2. Plug your adapter into a power source.
