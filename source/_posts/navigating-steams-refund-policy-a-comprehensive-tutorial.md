* Requests made within 14 days of purchase with less than two hours of play logged are generally eligible.

 It is easier than ever before to find and enjoy new games through Valve’s game client[ Steam](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380) . From the best AAA titles to hidden indie gems, there are thousands of options from Alpha to the polished product. However, not all games are equal and you may have purchased a game that you want to return. Here's what you need to know about refunding a game on Steam.

##  Conditions for Refunds From Steam 

 Unlike buying a physical copy of a game, you can get a refund from Steam even on a brand-new game, even if you're returning it because you just didn't like it or you've played it extensively.

### Eligible Refunds 

 While you can request a refund on any game, in most cases you’ll only be able to get your money back in very specific cases.

* **General two-week, two-hour rule** : So long as you request a refund within 14 days of purchase, and it has been played for less than two hours, you'll almost always get a refund.
* **Pre-ordered games** : With games you have preordered, you can request a refund up until 14 days after the initial release—and within the same play window (less than two hours).
* **Downloadable content (DLC)** : The same rules apply to[ DLC games](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-dlc-in-gaming-how-does-it-work-4707377) bought through Steam, but some content isn't eligible for refunds. These items are marked as nonrefundable in the Steam Store.
* **Steam Wallet** : If you want a refund for Steam Wallet funds, you need to request it within 14 days and also need to ensure none of the funds were spent in the meantime.
* **Subscriptions** : You can request a refund within 48 hours of the automatic renewal date if you haven't use the subscription during that billing period.
* **In-app purchases** : Steam will issues refunds within 48 hours after in-app purchases, assuming the game developer offers refunds on the item you bought.

* **Hardware** : Some[ hardware might qualify for a refund](https://store.steampowered.com/hardware%5Forder%5Fterms) .
* **Gifts** : If a gift hasn't been redeemed, the receiver has the standard time frame to initiate a refund request on behalf of the purchaser.
* **Bundles** : If there is a bundle you want to return, the original two-hour, 14-day conditions remain. However, this counts for all games in the bundle.

 If you are outside that grace period you can still request a refund. However, you'll want to be specific when entering information about why you are requesting a refund. The more details you provide, the more likely you'll be approved for a refund. 

###  Ineligible Refund Items 

 Steam specifically will not refund you in several cases:

* **Valve anti-cheat system (VAC)** : If you want a refund because you received a VAC, you won't be eligible for a refund.
* **Video purchases** : There also isn't any way for Steam to refund video purchases, unless the video was part of a bundle.

 Steam will still consider why you want a refund on your purchase if you don't meet these requirements.

 You can visit Steam's site to get all the details on[ what is and isn't likely to get a refund](https://store.steampowered.com/steam%5Frefunds/) .

6. Then click**I'd like to request a refund.**

 At this point, you've opened a support ticket from Steam. You should receive further information from them via email explaining why you will or won't receive a refund.

## Denied Refund? 

 If you are denied a refund and think it's a mistake, there is technically a way to appeal.

 You can request a refund a second time, and open another support ticket. A different employee will review your request, and double-check to make sure you weren't denied a refund unfairly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  When to Expect Your Refund 

 Once you have filled out your support ticket and receive confirmation from Steam that you'll be receiving a refund, the big question is when? In most cases, barring major bank holidays, you can expect to see your refund within a week.

 If it has been seven or more days since your refund confirmation, you can reach out to your financial institution and inquire about pending transactions. In cases of international refunds, it can take a few more days to process. 

 Your refund will be returned to the original payment method. So if you paid with your bank card or credit card you can expect to see it show up there.

 Keep in mind that some payment methods available through stream[ do not support refunding back to the original payment method](https://store.steampowered.com/steam%5Frefunds%5Fmethods) . If your card isn't on the list, you'll see your refund show up in your Steam Wallet.

 If you paid with Steam funds or Steam is unable to refund back to the original method, you will see your refund in your Steam Wallet.
