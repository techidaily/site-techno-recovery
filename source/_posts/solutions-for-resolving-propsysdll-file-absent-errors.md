## How to Fix Mfc71.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download the mfc71.dll DLL file individually from any "DLL download site." There are many reasons why[downloading DLLs from these sites is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's always best to obtain it from its legitimate, original source.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . Sometimes mfc71.dll errors are one-time issues and a simple reboot will fix the problem. It's not a very likely solution, but it's an easy first step that could just save the day.
2. [Reinstall the program or game](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If you receive a "mfc71.dll not found" error when you open a specific application, reinstall the application. The installation should restore this DLL file to its proper location.  
 Even if you're not asked, be sure to restart your computer after the uninstallation and before the reinstallation. Restarting your computer at this point will help to make sure that any loaded files are cleared from memory and that the uninstallation is totally complete.
3. Download the latest update to the program. Visit the software program's website and download the latest[service pack](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) ,[patch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) , or other update. It's possible that the mfc71.dll error may have been corrected in an update issued by the program creators.

4. [Install any suggested Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Certain security and other updates from Microsoft are known to correct issues with or replace the mfc71.dll file.
5. [Scan your computer for viruses and malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mfc71.dll errors are caused by malicious software that found its way into your system.
6. If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (most people aren't),[visit Microsoft's website to download the latest update to Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/update-visual-studio) .
7. Reinstall the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your Broadcom wireless network card. This solution only applies when your mfc71.dll error is accompanied by a message about the bcmwltry.exe file. You can update these drivers by visiting[Broadcom's website](https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search?pf=Ethernet+Controllers) .  
 Many computer manufacturer's use Broadcom's network[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) in their computers, so the best source for drivers, in this case, would be your computer manufacturer's website. For instance, many Dell, Gateway, and HP computers use Broadcom's network hardware.  
 See[How to Update Drivers in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) if you need help. If you can't find the right driver through the Broadcom website, consider using a[free driver updater program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-driver-updater-tools-2619206) .
