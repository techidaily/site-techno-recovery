 It's all in the name. CaliCase’s Universal Waterproof Floating Case is an excellent choice for outdoor adventurers who enjoy boating, rafting, or kayaking.

 Pros

* Universal compatibility
* Designed to float
* Available in lots of fun colors

 Cons

* Doesn't fit "Max" or "Ultra" sized phones

 After all, even a waterproof case with hundreds of feet of protection won’t do you much good if you can’t retrieve your valuable smartphone from the bottom of the lake it fell into.

 CaliCase still offers up to 100 feet of water protection for up to 30 minutes, but thanks to built-in foam padding that keeps it bobbing to the surface, your smartphone is unlikely to ever reach that depth.

 Dual-layer PVC plastic makes the case sturdy enough to handle everyday bumps and drops. Transparent windows on both sides let you use your phone and take pictures while it's still in the case. It’s available in a range of fun colors and fits all standard smartphone sizes.

**Compatibility** : iPhone X-15/Samsung Galaxy S20-S24/Google Pixel 4-8

 Premium smartphones like the iPhone Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy Ultra take great photos on land and above water.

 If you’re looking to explore the final frontier of underwater photography, you’ll need a case like the LY Lanyos Snorkeling Diving Phone Case.

 Pros

* Camera grip and shutter button for easy photo capture
* Rugged and durable build

 Cons

* Not designed for everyday use

 The sturdy case protects your smartphone for extended periods at depths of up to 50 feet, so it’s great for everything from skiing and surfing to snorkeling and swimming. 

 This case has a control panel with a shutter button and a lanyard to keep your phone close. It's a highly protective case for underwater use, and you can remove it once you're out of the water.

##  What to Look For in a Waterproof Phone Case 

**Compatibility** 

 Waterproof cases come in two general styles—those designed for specific smartphone models and universal ones that can fit several models. When buying a universal model, you’ll want to make sure that it fits your phone in size and passes through all the necessary buttons, ports, and other functions you may want to use while it’s in the case. 

**Versatility** 

 If you plan to use a waterproof case while on vacation or a day at the beach, it’s handy to get one that also can replace your wallet by allowing you to store a few other essential items, such as the card key for your hotel room or a little emergency cash. 

**Buoyancy** 

 Protecting your phone against deep water doesn’t help if you can’t get it back after it goes into the lake, so if you’re into activities like boating, kayaking, or rafting, you’ll want to look for a floatable case. These generally offer good depth protection, but you may never need that because your phone will float back to the surface.

 FAQ

* Why do I need a waterproof case when my phone is already waterproof?  
 Most smartphones are_water-resistant_ , not necessarily waterproof. This means they’ll generally handle being temporarily dunked in the water, but all bets are off if they go over the side of your boat. Further, even though their phones promise to be water-resistant, companies like Apple and Samsung won’t cover them under warranty if any water damage is detected. A waterproof case will offer much better water protection—often to 10 times more depth—and guard against drops, scuffs, and scratches.
* Can I go scuba diving with a waterproof case?  
 The short answer is yes, provided you have a waterproof case certified to the depth you plan to dive—and how long you plan to be under. Many of the best waterproof cases are suitable for submersion in up to 100 meters of water, but you’ll want to read the fine print to see how long they’re designed to withstand that. Some cases only protect your smartphone from being accidentally dropped in the water—they’re not intended for long-term underwater use—so if you plan to take your phone down with you, ensure you get a waterproof case built for it.
* What do these IP ratings mean?  
 IP, or "Ingress Protection" codes, refer to how well an enclosure is sealed against foreign particles and moisture. They’re expressed by the letters “IP” followed by two numbers, such as "IP68." The first number represents how well a case is protected against solid particles like dust and dirt, while the second protects against water and other liquids. The higher each number, the better the protection. However, it’s important to note that the scale typically maxes out at IP68, which means a case is dust-tight and offers a minimum of protection against immersion in 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. This means that the level of protection provided by IP68 cases and enclosures can vary greatly, so always check the specific protection levels offered by each case.
