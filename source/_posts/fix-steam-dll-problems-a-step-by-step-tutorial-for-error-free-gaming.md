## How to Fix Missing Hal.dll Errors

 Below are several possible fixes to try. Follow these steps in the order they're given to try the simpler solutions first.

1. Restart your computer. It's possible that the error could be a fluke.  
 Since hal.dll errors appear before Windows is fully loaded, it's not possible to[properly restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . Instead, you'll need to force a restart. You can do that by pressing or holding down the physical power button until the computer shuts down; press it once to start it back up.
2. [Check for proper boot order in BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-in-bios-2624528) . You might see the error if the[boot order](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-boot-sequence-2625814) in[BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-basic-input-output-system-2625820) is first looking at a hard drive other than your main hard drive. The error appears because the other drive doesn't have a file called hal.dll.  
 This is likely the problem if you recently changed the boot order or[flashed your BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-bios-4783238) .
3. [Run System Restore from Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-start-system-restore-from-the-command-prompt-2624522) . If this doesn't work, or you're receiving the error message before you're able to complete this process, move on to the next step.
4. [Repair or replace the boot.ini file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-repair-or-replace-boot-ini-in-windows-xp-2624512) . This will work if the cause of the problem is actually the boot.ini file and not hal.dll, which is often times the case.
5. [Write a new partition boot sector](https://www.lifewire.com/write-a-new-partition-boot-sector-to-a-windows-xp-system-partition-2624503) to the system partition. If the boot sector has become corrupt or isn't properly configured, you may receive the hal.dll error.
6. [Recover data from any bad sectors](https://www.lifewire.com/locate-recover-data-from-bad-sectors-within-recovery-console-2624501) on your hard drive. If the physical part of your drive that stores any part of the hal.dll file has been damaged, you're likely to see errors like this.
7. [Restore the hal.dll file from the Windows XP CD](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-hal-dll-from-the-windows-xp-cd-2624517) . If the DLL file is truly the cause of the problem, restoring it from the original XP CD may do the trick.
8. [Perform a repair installation of Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-perform-a-windows-xp-repair-install-2624915) . This type of installation_should_ replace any missing or corrupt files. Continue troubleshooting if this doesn't resolve the issue.
9. [Perform a clean installation of Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-xp-2624911) . This type of installation will completely remove Windows from your PC and install it again from scratch, so it will certainly resolve any hal.dll errors.  
 If you can't gain access to your files to back them up, you should understand that you will lose them all if you continue with a clean installation.
10. [Test the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . If all else has failed, including the clean installation from the last step, you're most likely facing a hardware issue with your hard drive, but you'll want to test it to be sure.  
 If the drive fails any of your tests,[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) and then[complete a new installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-a-windows-operating-system-2624925) .

![Hal.dll Error Message](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/iW96xBd-pVPkCbR8_ExyONSabUM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hal-dll-missing-corrupt-xp-57fd205d3df78c690f815007.PNG)

 There are a few ways the "missing or corrupt hal.dll" error may present itself, with the first listing being the most common:

* **Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \\system32\\hal.dll. Please re-install a copy of the above file.**
* **\\System32\\Hal.dll missing or corrupt: Please re-install a copy of the above file.**
* **Cannot find \\Windows\\System32\\hal.dll**
* **Cannot find hal.dll**

 The "missing or corrupt" error displays shortly after the computer is first started. Windows hasn't yet fully loaded when this message appears.

 Causes of the "missing or corrupt hal.dll" error include, naturally, a damaged[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) or a hal.dll file that has been deleted or moved from its intended location.

 Additional causes may include a damaged or missing boot.ini file, or possibly a physically damaged[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) .

 This is a Windows XP error. Other Windows operating systems, like[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) or[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , might also experience this problem. See[how to fix hal.dll errors in newer versions of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hal-dll-errors-in-newer-versions-of-windows-2619245) if you're not using Windows XP.
