## Building Your Personalized GPT-3 Powered Conversation Agent Using Microsoft's Advanced Bot Framework

### Key Takeaways

* The use the custom bot feature, first become a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, then click "Explore" in the left-hand sidebar.
* Under "My GPTs" click "Create a GPT," then start building your bot by giving it prompts.
* After giving it a name and profile picture, you'll follow ChatGPT's prompts to finalize it and then click "Save" to save your custom GPT.

 While custom instructions, plugins, and clever prompts have offered some ways to customize your ChatGPT experience, you can now create your own fine-tuned chatbot, and OpenAI has made it so easy anyone can do it.

##  What Is a Custom ChatGPT Bot?

 The standard generic ChatGPT bot you speak to is a jack of all trades. It's open to anything, and that's fine for generic use. However, if you want it to be good at one specific set of tasks, you'd usually have to access it through an API ([Application Programming Interface](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-unsung-free-speech-to-text-apps-for-your-mac/)) and then have to use your software development and machine learning know-how to "fine tune" that vanilla GPT flavor into something appropriate such as a customer service bot, or a research assistant in a specific field.

 With the new custom bot feature in [ChatGPT Plus](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) (the paid premium service) you can get most of the benefit of that fine-tuning without being a computer scientist yourself. For example, here's the custom writing assistant bot I created, named Rei.

![An description of a custom ChatGPT Bot named "Rei" that acts as a writing assistant.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rei-custom-bot.png) 

 During the customization of this bot, I taught it who I am, what I do, and what specific types of tasks I need help with. Now that ChatGPT can access the web, I could craft a bot that would help me with sourced research, could come up with outlines or ideas, and give me editorial feedback on anything I write. However, this is just one possibility. You could make a bot that helps you pick out what movies to watch, or come up with schedules and activities for your kids. Sound good? Let's look at how to build a bot,

##  How to Build Your Bot Step-by-Step

 Creating your own fine-tuned custom ChatGPT bot is pretty straightforward, and the obvious starting point is to log into your ChatGPT Plus account in your browser. Then click on the "Explore" button in the lefthand sidebar.

![The ChatGPT web interface with the "Explore" button highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chatgpt-custom.png) 

 Now, under "My GPTs", click on "Create a GPT."

![The ChatGPT web interface with "Create a GPT" highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/create-a-gpt.png) 

 Now you're in the GPT Builder. The tool is split into two sections. On the left, you have the actual builder. On the right, you have a preview of the bot you're making. You can interact with it and test it on the fly.

 On the left side of the builder, there are two tabs labeled "Create" and "Configure." If you like, you can head straight to "Configure" section and just fill everything in manually, but for most people it's best to start with the "Create" side of things. The GPT Builder is actually a custom chatbot itself, so you can create your bot by having a conversation with it. So let's start by telling GPT Builder what we'd like to create. In this case I start the conversation with "I want to create a bot that will help me research computer components on the web, and then help me put together desktop PC builds for a given budget."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 You'll see the builder working on your bot in the background, and it will likely suggest a name. You can either accept the name, or specify a new one. Once the name is nailed down, GPT Builder will use [DALL-E 3](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-complete-user-manual-how-to-use-screen-recording-on-mac-for-2024/) to generate a profile image for the bot. You can ask for something different, or you can upload your own image later after the bot is finalized.

 You'll see the bot's name and description on the right-hand side in the preview section. Meet the "HTG PC Builder", which helps you plan your PC builds.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 With the name and profile image done, the builder will start asking you questions specific to the type of bot you've asked for. This is going to differ for everyone, so just keep going until GPT builder tells you you're all set.

![GPT Builder asks questions about the specific tweaks the user wants to make to their bot.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gpt-builder-questions.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then test the bot on the right-hand side by using as intended. If you're not happy, talk to GPT builder about your concerns or switch to the "Configure" tab to tweak things directly.

![The manual configuration page for GPT Custom bots.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/configure-tab-gpt-custom-bot.png) 

 When you're happy with your bot, click on the "Save" button, select the privacy level you want, and then click "Confirm."

![The GPT Custom bot Save Button with private, semi-private, and public publishing options.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gpt-save-button.png) 

 You'll now find your new bot listed under ChatGPT. If you want to edit your bot later, you can just go back to "Explore" and click the pencil icon next to your bot to open GPT Builder again.

##  What Are the Limits of a Custom Bot?

 Custom bots are quite powerful, but they aren't the fully-fledged custom bot experience you'd get by hand-tuning GPT for your own app, for example. These bots have to be used through the ChatGPT interface for ChatGPT Plus. That means this isn't a good solution for creating business-class AI chatbot tools, but it's perfect for individuals, and perhaps even small teams.

 One really useful feature is that you can publish your bot so that other people can use it, and you can do it semi-privately by choosing to only give access to people with the link. So if you have a team of people with ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, you can share your bot with them.

 You can give ChatGPT bots image files, CSV files, and Excel files to serve as a source of information to do the job you want them to do. You can do this by uploading files under the "Knowledge" section of the "Configure" tab in GPT Builder. However, at the time of writing some users are managing to [extract those files](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-custom-chatbots-gpts-prompt-injection-attacks/). So do not upload any knowledge files that contain sensitive information! Especially if you intend to share your bot.

 ChatGPT has gone from an impressive if rather aimless AI tool, to a flexible service that can offer pin-point solutions to just about any need a chatbot could feasibly fulfil,and hopefully you now have exactly the bots you need.
