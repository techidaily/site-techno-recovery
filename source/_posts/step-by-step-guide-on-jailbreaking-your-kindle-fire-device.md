Kindle Fire is one of the most popular tablets at present. Besides great e-book reading experience, the Android OS gives Kindle Fire more playability. As we know, rooting is the first thing you need to do before modifying your own Android system. It makes you become the ultimate administrator of the system. But rooting is not an easy job, especially for the custom Android like Kindle Fire runs. So here comes this article to show you how to root a Kindle Fire in a simple way. Just read it and then root your device!

#### You need to know three things before reading

1 This tutorial is only for the original Kindle Fire. If you want to know how to root Kindle Fire 2nd gen, please view this post: [Rooted Kindle Fire 2nd Generation](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2019547).

2 Rooting Kindle Fire is very strict on the system version. This rooting tutorial is for the latest 6.3.x (6.3.1 and 6.3.2). It may be not suitable for the older version. Here is a tutorial for rooting version 6.2.x:[BurritoRoot3 - Kindle Fire Root. Easy root edition](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1410223).

3 Some professional terms  
**fbmode**: Fast Boot Mode  
**firefirefire**: A Bootloader  
**twrp**: TeamWin Recovery Project  
 You don't need to understand these professional terms. Just remember they are necessary for rooting. 

### **Step 1 Get rooting tools**

We've packed all the rooting tools together. [Click here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1414832) to download the rooting tools.

### **Step 2 Open CMD and run ADB**

Extract the zip files in step1\. Open the extracted folder, press on "Shift" and right click in the blank. Choose "Open command window here" and CMD window will pop up.

![how to root kindle fire-enter cmd](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/1-how to root kindle fire-enter cmd.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Type these commands one by one to make your Kindle Fire enter fbmode. Remember to type the next command when the last command has run. Pay attention to the blank space.

**1\. adb push fbmode /data/local/fbmode** 
 **2\. adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/fbmode** 
 **3\. adb shell /data/local/fbmode** 
 **4\. adb reboot**

When you run the 4th command, the Kindle Fire will reboot and stick on the "Kindle Fire" logo. Don't worry. This means your device has entered the fbmode successfully. Now type another commands to install firefirefire and twrp on you Kindle Fire.

**1\. fastboot -i 0x1949 flash bootloader u-boot.bin** 
**2\. fastboot -i 0x1949 flash recovery twrp.img** 
**3\. fastboot -i 0x1949 oem idme bootmode 4000** 
**4\. fastboot -i 0x1949 reboot**

Now your Kindle Fire will reboot. You may find that the boot screen has changed and there is a notice which says "press power button for boot menu" displayed on the bottom of the screen. Long press power button and choose "Recovery". Then Kindle Fire will enter TWRP. Just like this:

![how to root kindle fire-twrp](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/2-how to root kindle fire-twrp.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
You don't need do anything on your Kindle Fire. Go on typing commands in CMD:

**1\. adb shell mount system** 
**2\. adb push su /system/xbin/su** 
**3\. adb shell chown 0.0 /system/xbin/su** 
**4\. adb shell chmod 06755 /system/xbin/su**

Now go back to TWRP on you Kindle Fire. Choose 'Reboot" – "System" and your device will reboot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Step 3 Install superuser**

Transfer the superuser apk file to your Kindle Fire. Install it with ES File Explorer.

![how to root kindle fire-install superuser](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-how to root kindle fire-install superuser.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Now you've got all rooting job done! Every time you run an app which needs some permission, a window will pop up like this:

If you can see this picture on your device, that means you've rooted your Kindle Fire successfully!

 Would it be possible to help me please?

Hi, Hannibal. We've just tested the rar file. It can be extracted indeed. Perhaps it's the system compatibility which cause the extracting error. Or you can try another extracting tool like the 7-zip.

I got through the first 4 steps no problem. Like you said it will reboot and Kindle Fire logo stays on screen but when I entered fastboot -i 0x1949 flash bootloader u-boot.bin it gets stuck and tells me it is "waiting on device". Let it sit for about an hour and nothing. Tried a hard reset and the steps again. Nothing. What do I do next. I have tried KFU but it can't find device,probably because it is not booted up. The driver is also missing in Device Manager now. Running Win8 Pro 64\. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,medic245lccfr  
 According to your description, I guess it's the usb driver's problem. Try to reinstall the usb driver. Another reason for this may be that you use the Win 8 Pro 64.System incompatibility always causes many unexpected problems.

Thanks for your help, however the first problem I ran into was I have a 64bit machine, that was easy to take care of, i got a 32bit one. Second when I attempted to run the adb programs, I got device not found, and I could not see any hints on this page to correct????????
