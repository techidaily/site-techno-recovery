## What's Next for Apple? Insights on the Upcoming iPhone Modelâ€™s Release Date and Specs

 In This Article

* [Latest News](https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-the-latest-news-about-iphone-17)

 The iPhone 17 is the 2025 model of the iPhone, the successor to the not-yet-released[iPhone 16](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-16-news-and-rumors-7111749) . It's expected to deliver a major screen upgrade, higher-resolution cameras, faster processors, and more.

## When Will iPhone 17 Be Released?

 The iPhone 17 release date has not been announced, but it's likely to be in Fall 2025\. Apple is very consistent with its[iPhone release dates](https://www.lifewire.com/when-does-new-iphone-come-out-1999740) :

* **iPhone 15 series:** Sept. 22, 2023
* **iPhone 14 series:** Sept. 16, 2022
* **iPhone 13 series:** Sept. 24, 2021

 Given that, it's reasonable to expect a mid-September to early-October 2025 iPhone 17 release date. The phone's announcement will likely come a few weeks before that.

 Like in previous years, there will be several models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Slim.

### Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

A September 2025 release date seems like a lock.

## iPhone 17 Price Rumors

 Just like with release dates, Apple is consistent in[the pricing of new iPhones](https://www.lifewire.com/cost-of-iphone-1999299) . While nothing has been confirmed, expect that the iPhone 17 price will be very similar to previous models, if not the exactly same. The launch price of the entry-level model of the last three iPhones was:

* **iPhone 15 (128GB):** US$799
* **iPhone 14 (128GB):** $799
* **iPhone 13 (128GB):** $799

 So, the iPhone 17 price might vary a little, but a starting price around $799 is a safe bet, with the cost going up based on screen size and storage. And of course, the Pro version will be more expensive.

## Pre-Order Information

 The iPhone 17 will go up for pre-order once Apple makes it official. Check back here for info once it's available.

## iPhone 17 Specs & Features

 The iPhone 17 is rumored to introduce some major upgrades to its screen, big improvements to the cameras, faster processors, and more. Here's a summary of what's rumored:

* Always-on ProMotion screen for all models, with screen refresh as low as 1Hz
* Better screen scratch protection
* Under-screen Face ID
* Apple A18 processor and Wi-Fi 7 chip
* 48-megapixel telephoto lens and 24-megapixel selfie camera
* Better low-light photography
* Physically larger phones
* More AI features.

### Screen

 The iPhone 17 series screen is rumored to receive three notable upgrades.

 First,[Mashable (among others) cites a Korean report](https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-17-promotion-always-on-display) that the iPhone 17 will get the Always-On 120Hz ProMotion screens on all models. Today, Always-On[ProMotion](https://www.lifewire.com/why-promotion-on-the-iphone-13-is-a-big-deal-5201956) screens are only available on Apple's higher-priced Pro models. ProMotion, first introduced on the[2017 iPad Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-comparison-chart-1994214) , improves the smoothness of scrolling and video playback.

[TechRadar notes](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17-could-have-a-screen-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-years-for) that this new screen may be able to drop its refresh rate from 120Hz down to 1Hz. This would allow the phone to save significant battery life when displaying static content, like when using the Always-On screen option or[StandBy](https://www.lifewire.com/use-standby-with-iphone-7555806) .

 Lastly,[MacRumors shares a Chinese report](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/) that the iPhone 17 screen will use a new, "super-hard anti-reflective layer" to prevent scratches and screen damage, replacing the current ceramic shield technology.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Face ID

 Ross Young, an industry analyst with Display Supply Chain Consultants,[says that the iPhone 17 Pro models will bring a big change to Face ID](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/) : Instead of using a camera notch at the top of the screen, the[Face ID](https://www.lifewire.com/face-id-4151714) will be embedded under the phone's screen. While the selfie camera cutout would stay, moving the Face ID sensors under the screen would be a step towards getting rid of the notch entirely and having an all-screen front on a future iPhone model.

### Processor and Chips

 Each year, Apple introduces a new processor that powers the iPhone. Based on past evolution of those chips, expect the iPhone 17 series to be built around the not-yet-revealed Apple A18 processor.

 Beyond that,[HotHardware says](https://hothardware.com/news/apples-iphone-17-could-have-heavily-revised-selfie-camera) that the iPhone 17 will include an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip that supports[Wi-Fi 7](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-7-6950913) , allowing the phone to use the 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and 6Ghz Wi-Fi bands at the same time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Camera

 Rumors suggest at least three key improvements to the iPhone 17 series cameras.

 First, MacRumors shares talk about improved resolution to the telephoto camera on the back of the phone. According to that site,[the telephoto camera will move to 48 megapixels](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/) , up from 12 megapixels on the iPhone 15\. This improvement is expected only on the iPhone 17 Pro Max for now.

 According to_The Information_ , the rear cameras in the iPhone 17 Slim might be moved to the top center.

 Additionally,[MacRumors also says to expect](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/) that the selfie camera on the front of iPhone 17 models will offer 24-megapixel resolution, up from 12 megapixels on the iPhone 15.  

 Lastly, noted Apple analyst Kuo Ming-Chi suggests that[the camera lenses on the iPhone 17 will be built using 6 elements](https://hothardware.com/news/apples-iphone-17-could-have-heavily-revised-selfie-camera) , up from 5 on current models, which will improve image quality, especially in low-light situations.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Phone Size

 While not a widely reported rumor,[HotHardware says](https://hothardware.com/news/apples-iphone-17-could-have-heavily-revised-selfie-camera) that the iPhone 17 may change its physical dimensions, becoming taller and skinnier, with a 19.6:9 aspect ratio (the aspect ratio of current iPhone is 16:9).

### AI

 While there are no specific rumors about the use of[AI](https://www.lifewire.com/artificial-intelligence-and-science-6386405) in the iPhone 17 yet, it's an absolute certainty that that model, and its version of the iOS, will feature lots of new AI tools. What they are depends on[what features debut with the iPhone 16/iOS 18 in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-is-using-ai-everywhere-7509132) , and how the rapidly changing AI field evolves, but count on some new artificial intelligence enhancements.
