## How to Combine Two Playlists on Spotify With the Desktop App

 The easiest way to merge two or more playlists on Spotify is by manually copying over songs from one or more playlists to a new playlist. This works best in the desktop app. Here are those directions:

 The process of merging playlists is nearly identical on Windows and Mac. The screenshots below correspond to the Spotify app for Mac, but Windows-specific directions are noted where appropriate.

1. Open the app and select the playlist you’d like to move songs from.

 FAQ  

* How do I merge playlists on Spotify web player?  
    You can merge playlists in the Spotify web player the same way you can in the app. Select multiple tracks or locate the three-dot menu next to a singe song, then right-click it and select**Add to playlist** to see your options. The web version works best for playing existing playlists and[creating new Spotify playlists](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-playlist-on-spotify-4138575) .
