##  Best Free Service: Peacock

![Peacock's TV show homepage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AhfGmBRuB_G-H1a5T967n8ZrP_w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/peacock-tv-home-15cf5fe2e8394a8da6d7357ab4ed27ae.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Biggest library out there you can stream for free.
* Mega-hit exclusives.
* Lots of original content coming.
* Extras like sports, live news, and Spanish language programming available without add-on purchase.

 What We Don't Like

* No 4K or HDR streaming.
* Offline viewing locked to Premium Plus plan.
* Not much original content current available.

[ Our Review of Peacock ](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nbcuniversal-peacock-4770914) 

**Plans** 

* **Premium** (no ads): $5.99/month or $59.99 annually.
* **Premium Plus** (no ads): $11.99/month or $119.99 annually.

**Add-ons** 

 None

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 3

**Where does it work?** 

 Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Android TVs, Apple TV, Roku devices, Chromecast, LG Smart TVs, PlayStation 4, Vizio TVs, Xbox One, Cable Provider Set Top Boxes

 Take a look at[ Peacock's official compatibility list](https://www.peacocktv.com/help/article/what-devices-and-platforms-are-supported-by-peacock) to make sure your specific devices are supported before signing up.

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Peacock is a relative newcomer to the streaming service party, but NBC's service is aggressively pursuing exclusives, making it the only place to watch a lot of beloved content, like_Law & Order_ (and_Criminal Intent_ ), the[ _Harry Potter_ movies](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-harry-potter-movies-in-order-5084792) ,_The Office_ , or even CBS's_King of Queens_ , which isn't available on the CBS streaming service Paramount+ and hasn't been available to stream before.

 While Peacock's well of original content is fairly dry in the present day, the service has announced a huge slate of content in production, like Tina Fey's comedy series_Girls5Eva_ . Luxury features like 4K and HDR streaming also didn't make the cut at launch, but they could be coming at a later date.

## Best TV Catalog: Hulu

![Hulu's homepage on a computer](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UwVEHwKRI1GtP64br9rvap60Spo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hulu-home-c211b0c5a8d64573affc125ba5bf0a34.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Stream shows that are currently airing.
* Large back catalog of TV shows and anime.
* Tons of add-ons, like HBO, Showtime, Starz, and more.
* Cost-effective bundles.

 What We Don't Like

* Fewer acclaimed original shows than Netflix.
* No HDR support.
* Limited offline viewing.

[ Our Review of Hulu ](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hulu-4783546) 

**Plans** 

 The ad-supported option is 30 days free, and then $7.99 a month. Hulu without ads is 30 days free then $17.99 a month.

 You can also pick up Hulu as part of a bundle and with or without the live TV option. Here's a breakdown of the different options and their monthly prices:

| |  Hulu                     | Disney+ | ESPN+ | Live TV | Ad-free | Price  |        |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Hulu (with ads)             | **◯**   | $7.99 |         |         |        |        |
| Duo Basic                   | **◯**   | **◯** |         | $9.99   |        |        |
| Hulu (no ads)               | **◯**   | **◯** | $17.99  |         |        |        |
| Trio Basic                  | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | $14.99  |        |        |
| Duo Premium                 | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | $19.99  |        |        |
| Trio Premium                | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   | $24.99 |        |
| Hulu with Live TV (basic)   | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   |        | $76.99 |
| Hulu with Live TV (premium) | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   | **◯**  | $89.99 |

**Add-ons** 

 Showtime, Max, Cinemax, Starz, Entertainment (additional news and lifestyle programming), Español (access to Spanish language content), Unlimited Screens

 If you sign up for Max through Hulu, a tab appears on your Hulu account and HBO content is searchable on Hulu. However, you cannot stream all Max content, like_Friends_ , through Hulu, and you must instead sign in with your Hulu account on Max itself.

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 Both plans support up to two screens.

**Where does it work?** 

 Android phones, tablets, and TVs, Apple TV, Chromecast, Echo Show, Fire tablets, TV, and sticks, iOS devices, LG TVs, Switch, macOS, Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Roku, Roku sticks, Samsung TVs, Vizio SmartCast TVs, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xfinity Flex Streaming TV Box, and Xfinity X1 TV Boxes.

 Check[ Hulu's official compatibility list](https://help.hulu.com/s/article/supported-devices?language=en-US) to make sure your device is supported.

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Hulu succeeds where it matters most: delivering a well-rounded library of new and old shows people actually want to watch. Many of the shows that leave Netflix, like_Archer_ ,_It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ , or_Family Guy,_ end up on Hulu. This is in addition to Hulu's comprehensive selection of currently-airing shows, which is often a better way to watch than on cable because Hulu has plans without ads.

 Hulu also has its own lineup of original content, and all of its subscribers have access to HD and Ultra HD content (where available) as well as a limited selection of content available to download on supported devices.

##  Best for Original Content: Netflix

![Netflix's homepage for TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/iiMvOGTwLtT1ljZfKxY1zKvh0E4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netflix-tv-home-b84dace8b59d4f10925066e01c7d15e8.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Awesome variety of acclaimed original shows across genres that often run for multiple seasons.
* Large collection of TV and movies.
* Download supported shows and movies for offline viewing.
* 4K HDR support for Netflix Originals.

 What We Don't Like

* Increasing focus on producing original content at the expense of maintaining a back catalog of shows people want to watch.
* No currently airing TV support.
* No optional packages/add-ons.
* Discontinued free trial.

[ Our Review of Netflix ](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) 

**Plans** 

* **Standard with ads** : 1080p, two devices – $6.99/month
* **Standard** : 1080p, two devices, no ads – $15.49/month
* **Premium** : 4K & HDR, four devices, no ads – $22.99/month

**Add-ons** 

 None

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 Basic: 1\. Standard: 2\. Premium: 4.

**Where does it work?** 

 Streaming media players, smart TVs, game consoles, set-top boxes, Blu-ray players, smartphones, tablets, and computers. Many models of each are supported, but be sure to check[ Netflix's compatibility list.](https://devices.netflix.com/en/) 

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Netflix is unmatched in both quantity and quality of original content online. Even better are luxury features like[ 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) HDR streaming and the majority of[ Netflix Originals are available for offline viewing](https://www.lifewire.com/download-netflix-tv-shows-movies-4134207) .

 Unfortunately, all the money Netflix funnels into its original programming has come at the cost of the size and popularity of its larger library. Over the years, many shows have left Netflix to reappear on other sites. Hits like_Friends_ or_It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ have already made their way off the site, and the site's formerly most popular show,_The Office_ , left for Peacock in January 2021.

##  Best for Everything Disney: Disney+

![Disney+'s Marvel content homepage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1Ol0VZPVGhiWAuPNbdMyuRNTFjE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/disney-marvel-home-a3b69435381b4dcc8b5a00e4144fadff.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Best way to watch Disney content online, period.
* Exciting, big-budget originals based on Disney properties.
* Cheap, and even cheaper if bundled.
* Generous with screens and supports 4K HDR streaming.

 What We Don't Like

* Little need for separation between Hulu, a Disney owned streaming service, and Disney+ other than profit.
* Limited library of content compared to more comprehensive services like Netflix and Hulu.
* Will try to sell you movies like Mulan for $30 on top of a Disney+ subscription.
* Discontinued free trial.

[ Our Review of Disney+ ](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-on-disney-4687015) 

**Plans** 

 Monthly: $7.99 with ads, $13.99 with no ads.

 Hulu and Disney+ form a "Duo" bundle for $9.99 a month (ad-supported) or $19.99 a month (no ads). Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ are available in a "Trio" bundle for $14.99 a month with ads and $24.99 a month with no ads.

**Add-ons** 

 None

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 Four, though you can download movies and TV shows for offline viewing on up to ten mobile devices.

**Where does it work?** 

 macOS, Windows, Android phones and tablets, Apple iPhones and iPads, Amazon Fire Tablet, Android TVs, LG Smart TVs, Samsung Tizen Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromebook, Chromecast, Roku, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Vizio SmartCast TV

 Before you sign up, best to take a look at[ Disney+'s official compatibility list.](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp%5Farticle%5Fcontent&sys%5Fkb%5Fid=eac89167db3048900a2af56e0f96193b) 

**What's the takeaway?** 

 If you're a fan of anything Disney, Pixar, Marvel, or Lucasfilm, Disney+ is the exclusive home for this content. R-rated films and certain original content, like Marvel's_Runaways_ , are still available on Hulu. Disney+ also has content from National Geographic as well as a host of original content, like the mega-popular_The Mandalorian_ .

 While splitting up their streaming services may not have been the most cost-effective move for the consumer, Disney+ as a streaming service is an excellent value. It costs less than most of the competition, gives you exclusive access to some of the most popular shows and movies out there, and it's very generous with screens, allowing up to four. It also has offline viewing, allowing unlimited downloads on up to ten mobile devices.

##  Best Streaming Service for CBS and Beyond: Paramount+

![The Paramount+ website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FBpRiTdyiHzKTPJZ3vRjQkws_Ek=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1Paramount-07f7e3f37e63458fb2c16b1507f5803e.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 What We Like

* Impressive catalog of classics, legal and crime dramas, and original content.
* Included extras like sports and news programming.
* Watch currently airing CBS shows.
* Exclusive streaming access to new Paramount movies.

 What We Don't Like

* Smaller library compared to huge services like Netflix or Hulu.
* Offline viewing only available with commercial free plan.

[ Our Review of Paramount+ ](https://www.lifewire.com/cbs-all-access-4155838) 

**Plans** 

**Paramount+ Essential Plan** : $5.99 per month ($59.99 annually) with limited commercials.

**Paramount+ with Showtime Plan** : $11.99 per month ($119.99 annually) commercial-free (with the caveat that live TV still includes network commercials). Try either plan free for seven days.

**Add-ons** 

 Showtime (with a monthly subscription only)

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 3

**Where does it work?** 

 Apple TV, Chromecast, iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, LG, Samsung, Vizio, Xfinity, computer with Chrome or Firefox web browsers

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Paramount+ is different from many of the other offerings on this list because it doesn't have an exhaustive channel list. Rather, Paramount+ focuses on offerings from CBS and CBSN along with CBS Sports HQ and ET Live. Still, the library is bigger than you'd expect and includes_Star Trek: Discovery_ and other popular shows.

 With its deep CBS ties, Paramount+ is also the home of many crime and legal dramas, with options from_NCIS_ to_Criminal Minds._ One of the most popular legal dramas of all time,_The Good Wife,_ and its original spinoff,_The Good Fight_ , are available exclusively on Paramount+.

 Paramount+ builds on its previous incarnation, CBS All Access, adding exclusive streaming content from Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, and the Smithsonian Channel. You also gain access to hundreds of Paramount movies as well as live sports, original content, and reboots.

##  Best for Anime: Crunchyroll

![Crunchyroll's premium subscription page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/X9X8uPVNGlkvaKqyFQZWy4AnwXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/crunchyroll-subscription-page-0ae28328ba1041578c39c13984e91d52.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 What We Like

* The best place, hands down, to stream anime.
* Robust selection of Asian dramas.
* No paying to watch ads.

 What We Don't Like

* Dated, clunky interface.
* Expensive for what is a relatively small, niche library.
* Highest quality offered is 1080p.

[ Our Review of Crunchyroll ](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-crunchyroll-how-to-watch-anime-on-it-4775757) 

**Plans** 

 All Crunchyroll plans come with a 14-day free trial, but after that you have three options.

* **Fan** : No ads, one device – $7.99 a month
* **Mega Fan** : No ads, four devices, Game Vault, $15 store discount – $9.99 a month
* **Ultimate Fan** : No ads, six devices, Game Vault, $25 store discount – $14.99 a month.

 Crunchyroll doesn't have a "free" tier plan, but by simply accessing the service you can watch anime and Asian dramas for free with ads. You can also opt to pay every three months or every 12 months, which can bring the monthly cost down a fair bit, depending on your selected plan and billing cycle.

**Add-ons** 

 None

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 Fan: 1\. Mega Fan: 4\. Ultimate Fan: 6.

**Where does it work?** 

 iOS, Android, Windows Phone, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Chromecast, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV

 Check out[ Crunchyroll's official compatibility page](https://www.crunchyroll.com/devices) to be sure your personal device is supported.

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Both Netflix and Hulu continue to invest in their anime selections, which makes them more attractive with every passing year. However, Crunchyroll is still the undisputed king when it comes to streaming anime. You're able to watch a wide selection of currently-airing anime (with episodes released four hours after they go live in Japan) as well as a back catalog of anime. Crunchyroll's subtitles, while often not the very best in class, are always serviceable and never a let down.

##  Best for Live TV: Hulu + Live TV

![Hulu's Live TV service homepage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5o6a427Nwuz5ykH7hKmnO-z7uPg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hulu-livetv-home-079771095c2848c8a91286ecc70ec747.jpg) 

 What We Like

* 65+ channels, including sports and news.
* All of Hulu's library, including the back catalog, currently airing shows, and original content.
* Record your live TV with 50 included hours of Cloud DVR storage.
* Customize your experience by purchasing add-ons.

 What We Don't Like

* Fewer channels than competitors like FuboTV.
* Worse DVR than competitors like YouTube TV.
* Gaps in channel list like AMC, Comedy Central, or certain sports channels.

[ Our Review of Hulu + Live TV ](https://www.lifewire.com/hulu-live-tv-4165344) 

**Plans** 

 Hulu is available in a variety of options beyond just with or without ads. You can also pick it up in a bundle with Disney+ and ESPN+, and it has a live TV option. The following chart summarizes them, along with their monthly costs.

| |  Hulu                     | Disney+ | ESPN+ | Live TV | Ad-free | Price  |        |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |

| Duo Basic                   | **◯**   | **◯** |         | $9.99   |        |        |
| Hulu (no ads)               | **◯**   | **◯** | $17.99  |         |        |        |

| Trio Premium                | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   | $24.99 |        |
| Hulu with Live TV (basic)   | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   |        | $76.99 |
| Hulu with Live TV (premium) | **◯**   | **◯** | **◯**   | **◯**   | **◯**  | $89.99 |

**Add-ons** 

 Showtime, Max, Cinemax, Starz, Entertainment (additional news and lifestyle programming), Español (access to Spanish language content), Unlimited Screens

 If you sign up for Max through Hulu, a tab appears on your Hulu account and HBO content is searchable on Hulu. However, you cannot stream all Max content, like_Friends_ , through Hulu, and you must instead sign in with your Hulu account on Max itself.

**How many shows can you watch at once?** 

 Both plans support up to two screens.

**Where does it work?** 

 Android phones, tablets, and TVs, Apple TV, Chromecast, Echo Show, Fire tablets, TV, and sticks, iOS devices, LG TVs, Switch, macOS, Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Roku, Roku sticks, Samsung TVs, Vizio SmartCast TVs, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xfinity Flex Streaming TV Box, and Xfinity X1 TV Boxes.

 Check[ Hulu's official compatibility list](https://help.hulu.com/s/article/supported-devices?language=en-US) to make sure your device is supported.

**What's the takeaway?** 

 Considering Hulu + Live TV's lower price than competitors like YouTube TV or FuboTV; its serviceable if not spectacular lineup of channels larger than the equally priced DirecTV Stream service; and the huge library of content you get from Hulu itself, there's no better value for an all-around television fan.

 On paper, AppleTV+ is an exceptional deal: For $10 a month you get regular drops of new content made by people you recognize, support for up to six screens, offline viewing on Apple devices, and even 4K HDR streams of movies and TV shows. Some of Apple's original content has been reasonably well-received, like_Ted Lasso_ ,_The Morning Show,_ or_Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet_ , but the service hasn't had its_House of Cards_ or_Handmaid's Tale_ breakout hit yet.
