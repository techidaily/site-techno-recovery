## Advanced Techniques to Strengthen Bluetooth Signals on Your Windows Laptop or PC

Bluetooth issues, such as stuttering or sound delay, can be caused by a**bad connection** between your device and PC. To fix these issues, or you simply want a better connection even from afar, check out the tricks below that can help you master Bluetooth.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that gives you luck.

1. [**Remove or keep away from interference**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Bluetooth driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Try an external Bluetooth adapter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Remove or keep away from interference

 Bluetooth uses the 2.4GHz radio frequency to connect with your device, and this is the same frequency of your wireless router. When Wi-Fi could be the biggest interference, other Bluetooth devices can also conflict with your connection. So first check if you’re too close to the router, and move away from other Bluetooth devices.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to update your Bluetooth driver manually. To do this, visit the website of your motherboard manufacturer and search for your model. Usually you will find the driver installers in the support/download page.

### Option 2: Update your Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **Driver Easy** .

## Fix 4: Try an external Bluetooth adapter

 If you’re having issues with the Bluetooth adapter that comes with your PC or laptop, maybe you should consider an upgrade. Most of these adapters are still using Bluetooth 4 (or older), while**Bluetooth 5** has already flooded the market. If your device supports Bluetooth 5 (e.g. Apple AirPods), getting a Bluetooth 5 dongle will definitely give you a leg up.

 Bluetooth 5 (or above) introduces[a long range feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth%5F5) that can improve connection and greatly extend the range.

Bluetooth 5.0 adapter

And here’re some Bluetooth 5 dongles we recommended:
