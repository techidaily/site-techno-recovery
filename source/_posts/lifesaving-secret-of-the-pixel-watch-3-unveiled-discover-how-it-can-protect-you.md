Thanks to their health-monitoring capabilities, some wearables like [smartwatches](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/) and [smart rings](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smart-ring/) can gather data that reveals if a wearer is in a life-threatening situation. Google is investing more in that potential with a new feature for the newly unveiled [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-google-pixel-watch-3-these-three-best-features-make-a-difference/), currently set to roll out to users in nine countries next month.

At Made by Google, the company launched an AI-powered Loss of Pulse Detection feature exclusively for the [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US). "Loss of pulse" refers to a health emergency in which a person's heart suddenly stops beating for long enough to be concerning. It can indicate anything from cardiac arrest or circulatory failure to an overdose or a car accident.

Combining signals from the smartwatch's existing Heart Rate sensor with AI and motion sensor data, the opt-in feature can detect a change in the wearer's pulse while limiting false alarms. If the feature is having trouble detecting your pulse, it will trigger a check-in notification, and if you don't respond, the watch sounds an audible alarm alongside a countdown.

If there is still no response, the feature will prompt your device to call emergency support with an automated message explaining the loss of pulse alert and sharing your location. 

As Google pointed out during the event keynote, safety infrastructure is designed with the assumption that another person will be nearby during an emergency to call for help.

Loss of Pulse Detection is designed for instances where people may be alone and in life-threatening scenarios, aiming to expand that infrastructure to potentially connect more users to emergency care when needed. This could be especially impactful for solo hikers, drivers in rural areas, and more. 

Google shares that it worked with cardiologists and linked AI with clinical data to develop the feature. The company then used stunt actors wearing tourniquets "to artificially induce pulselessness," the [release](https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection/) explains, and test the detection.

"Loss of Pulse Detection is part of our broader effort to make Pixel Watch a guardian of your health and safety," Google explained. The feature joins other health-forward capabilities like [Fall](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-watch-fall-detection-ai/#link={) and [Car Crash Detection](https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/car-crash-detection/#link={), [Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications](https://store.google.com/magazine/fitbit%5Firregular%5Frhythm#link={), and [Safety Checks](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-watch-2/#link={). 

Loss of Pulse Detection will be available on [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3) in September across Europe, including in the UK, France, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Google said it is continuing to get regulatory approval to make the feature available elsewhere. Users can opt into the feature [here](http://g.co/fitbit/lossofpulse).
