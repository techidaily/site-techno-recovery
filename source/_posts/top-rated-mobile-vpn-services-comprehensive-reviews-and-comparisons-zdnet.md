## Top-Rated Mobile VPN Services : Comprehensive Reviews & Comparisons - ZDNet

[Virtual private networks (VPNs)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-does-it-work) protect your privacy online, whether you're browsing the internet at home or joining a public Wi-Fi network. While they're not a silver bullet, they can seriously improve your security when using any device, including the mobile devices that give you access to your social media, email, and financial services. 

**Also: [The best VPNs for Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-vpn/)**

While no service can guarantee absolute anonymity, you should always opt for a reputable VPN service with dedicated Android and iOS apps when you need a mobile-friendly VPN. VPNs can also improve your security when you have to rely on public Wi-Fi networks rather than cellular data. If you rely on a mobile device while you're away from home, you can also use it to access your streaming services from a different location than your home network.

## What is the best mobile VPN right now?

Our pick for the best mobile VPN overall is [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=378&aff%5Fid=307&source=zdnet&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&aff%5Fsub2=bestmobilevpn22), due to its user-friendly mobile app, expansive server network, and consistently strong speed and stable performance. We particularly like NordVPN's mobile user interface, too, as many other top VPN providers can fall short when it comes to mobile app design.

### NordVPN

#### Best mobile VPN overall

NordVPN is a fast and reliable VPN that runs well on an extensive server network, regardless of what you run it on.

Once you've learned NordVPN, there's no additional learning curve for using it on other devices. When you first open it, you'll see a landing screen map. From here, you can pick a country to VPN to or head to the fastest local server automatically. If your screen's too small for that to be handy, you're only a swipe away from a VPN server list.

**Also:** [**How does NordVPN work? Plus, how to set it up and use it**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-does-nordvpn-work-plus-how-to-set-it-up-and-use-it-tutorial/)

NordVPN also offers a kill switch. This automatically disconnects your phone or tablet from the internet if your VPN connection is interrupted, a key element to maintaining your privacy when using cellular networks. NordVPN allows you to have 10 simultaneous devices under one account, giving you plenty of optionality to connect your smartphones, tablets, PCs, TVs, and more.

In total, NordVPN provides 111 countries with servers to connect to.

I've used NordVPN for years and have always been impressed with its stable connectivity and rapid speeds. Customers generally report fast speeds and minimal buffering with easy setup, although some caution that you should turn off auto-renewal.

Two-year subscriptions begin at $3.09 per month, rising to $4.99 per month for one-year plans and $12.99 if you want to use the service for one month. Two-year plans come with three months of free access.

If you need additional security benefits, opt for the Ultimate plan, which includes coverage for identity theft and cyber extortion.

### Surfshark

#### Best budget mobile VPN

Surfshark is a solid VPN with interesting security features and a cheap price point, making it a desirable option.

Device connections are unlimited, the Bypasser function allows you to safelist specific apps to bypass the VPN, and there is a strict no-logs policy. The server list is impressive, and while the app's interface could use some optimization, it's still a great choice -- especially if you're looking for something affordable.

**Review: [Surfshark VPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)**

To help ensure no one can track you, SurfShark includes an exciting feature that enables you to spoof your GPS location. If someone tries to track down your location, it will report that you're at your VPN servers' coordinates.

I enjoy using Surfshark as a "one size fits all" VPN solution. Sometimes, the speeds aren't the best, but connecting is extremely quick. I also enjoy the "pause" function, which allows you to resume your regular connection for five minutes, 30 minutes, or a few hours. Customers say that speeds are relatively fast, streaming works most of the time, and many enjoy it as a beginner-friendly VPN.

Surfshark's cheapest plan is for a two-year subscription at $2.19 per month, with three months of free access added to the length of the term. There is also a 30-day money-back guarantee. 

**Surfshark features:** ****Simultaneous connections:** Unlimited | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Firefox, and Chrome | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries:** 100 | **Servers:** 3,200 | **Trial/MBG:** 30 days | **Google Play rating**: 4.6 | **App Store rating**: 4.8

Pros 
* Fast connection speeds

Network  2,000-plus servers in 75-plus locations across 52 countries

### IPVanish VPN

#### Best mobile VPN for customization

IPVanish is another of our favorite mobile VPNs. We are particularly impressed with the user interface on the Android and iOS apps, which is quick to install and extremely easy to use. It doesn't hurt that the app's interface is stylish and modern, although it doesn't look quite as good on PCs.

Speeds are reasonable, and the app quickly connects to a server nine times out of ten. IPVanish offers unlimited simultaneous connections, a helpful feature if you have multiple mobile devices, such as tablets or smartphones, to protect. The server network is of a reasonable size, although it doesn't match the likes of ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Overall, IPVanish provides a highly customizable VPN experience, and the range of settings you can change is the real strength of this option. It's also a good option for streaming.

Customers report they are happy with IPVanish's customer service and the overall speed and reliability of the VPN.

IPVanish offers a seven-day trial for mobile users. Alternatively, you can sign up for a two-year plan at $2.19 per month, a yearly plan for $2.79 per month, or you can opt for a monthly subscription for $12.99/month.

Price  $40 per year or $12 per month (3-year plans available at $79 every three years)

### Private Internet Access

#### Best open-source mobile VPN

Private Internet Access (PIA) offers impressive speed and security.

PIA has adopted open-source software for almost all of its components, which gives it a standout level of transparency surrounding its technology. This makes it open to examination by third parties. This helps with software vulnerabilities, too, as they may be more likely to be detected early and patched.

**Review: [Private Internet Access](https://www.zdnet.com/article/private-internet-access-review/)**

While the VPN provider is based in the US -- and this may turn some potential users away if they are concerned about privacy and data laws -- regarding features, PIA offers unlimited simultaneous connections, ad and malware blocking, and a strict no-logs policy. 

PIA is a solid and affordable VPN, but the user interface could be modernized. Customers say they are fans of the VPN's performance and encryption, which is also an excellent torrenting and streaming option.

PIA's two-year plans cost $2.19/month with two months of free access. Alternatively, PIA is one of the few VPN vendors that offers new subscribers a six-month plan, but it is more expensive at $7.50 per month. You could also opt for a monthly plan for $11.99.

### ExpressVPN

#### Best mobile VPN for speed

VPN speeds vary widely depending on where you are, the server you're trying to connect to, and the country distance. When it comes to speed for connections and streaming, ExpressVPN is often one of the best options.

Hit a button and connect to the fastest and closest ExpressVPN server. Of course, you can be selective with your servers, but it's hard to beat if you want to connect without any trouble or fuss, and often during testing, we find that no matter where the server is located, ExpressVPN is the fastest option.

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

ExpressVPN offers up to eight simultaneous devices on paid plans, and there are 105 countries within its server network. 

I've used ExpressVPN for years and found it to offer a speedy, reliable service with a great server network. On rare occasions, I've needed to switch servers, but aside from that, ExpressVPN is well worth the money. Customer reviews are generally positive regarding speed and streaming, but price hikes on renewal aren't popular. 

ExpressVPN can be purchased for $12.95 on a month-to-month plan, $9.99 per month for six months of access, or $6.67 per month on a two-year plan, with three months of free access thrown in and a year of Backblaze cloud backup.

**Express VPN features:** ****Simultaneous connections:** 8 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Amazon Fire, Android, and iOS | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Countries:** 105 | **Locations:** 160+ | **Trial/MBG:** 30 days | **Google Play rating**: 4.3 | **App Store rating**: 4.7

## Factors to consider when choosing a mobile VPN

When you are selecting your new mobile VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Price**: The overall price of your new VPN should factor into your decision. Try to take advantage of promotions, but ignore countdown timers -- they are typically just marketing tools. While top-notch VPNs can cost upwards of $10/month, many are available for only a few dollars.
* **Speed and stability**: Opt for a VPN that won't drastically reduce your speed and is known for stable connectivity.
* **Simultaneous connections**: If you're paying for a mobile VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or laptop. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least four to six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least this number.
* **Contract length**: You must also decide how long you'll need to use a VPN. A two-year term tends to secure the best prices, but monthly, six-month, and one-year options are often also available. After you've made a selection, you typically have a 30-day money-back guarantee. Make a note of when your contract ends, as you may want to shop around for a new deal.
* **Apps**: When selecting a mobile VPN, try it out first to ensure you like its accompanying iOS or Android app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but lack in the mobile app department, which may not be as intuitive or easy to use.
* **Trial periods**: Many VPN providers offer a free seven-day iOS or Android trial, so you can try before you buy. Head to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store to check.

## How we test VPNs

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

All VPN providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been writing about these VPNs for years, spoken with their management and users, and developed a generally favorable impression. Here are the top factors we consider during our testing process:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags, which is especially important when you're on mobile.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cares about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our mobile VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive mobile apps.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't try from all locations. Every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure. Once you choose, it's essential that you test for all your likely usage profiles and only then decide whether to keep the service or request a money-back guaranteed refund.

Check out our comprehensive [VPN testing methodology page](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/) for a more extensive breakdown.

## How do VPNs work?

Suppose you're at your desk and want to access a website like this one_._ To do this, your computer initiates a request by sending some packets. If you're in an office, those packets often travel through switches and routers on your LAN before transferring them to the public internet through a router.

**Also:** [**What is a VPN, and why do you need one?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-does-it-work/)

Once on the public internet, those packets travel through many computers. Your browser makes a separate request to a series of name servers to translate the DNS name ZDNET.com to an IP address. That information is sent back to your browser, which sends the request again through many computers on the public internet. Eventually, it reaches the ZDNET infrastructure, routes those packets, grabs a webpage (a bunch of separate elements), and sends all that back to you.

Each internet request usually involves a series of communication events between multiple points. A VPN encrypts those packets at the originating point, often hiding the data and the information about your originating IP address. The VPN software on your end then sends those packets to the VPN server at some destination point, decrypting that information. 

## Should I use a VPN on my mobile phone?

Yes, you should use a VPN whenever you can. It doesn't matter what device you are using, if it has any form of personal data on it, or if you are using the device to go online, you should invest in and run a VPN as a way to improve your privacy. 

## Does a VPN slow down your phone?

When using a VPN, a decrease in online speed is expected, although the best VPNs on the market shouldn't cause a speed loss of over 30%. Your phone's performance shouldn't be impacted, unless you have many apps running at the same time, as all apps require computing resources.

## What's the best free VPN service?

There is rarely an exception to a simple answer: none. The free ones that sound good will take you, your data, and your security for a ride. Avoid them.

A good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and many networking resources. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. If you use a free service, your data or information will probably be sold, and that's never good. After all, you're using a VPN to keep your data secure. You wouldn't want your data to go to some company to sift through -- it completely defeats the purpose of a VPN.

That said, we do recommend one free VPN service, offered by Proton, a trustworthy security and privacy-focused company. The trade-off is that the free option is extremely limited.

## Do I need a VPN if I'm traveling or using a Wi-Fi hotspot?

If you're [traveling](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-travel-vpn/) or using the internet in a public place like a coffee shop, data encryption is critical. Most public Wi-Fi hotspots are open and unencrypted, which means anyone on the network can see what you send, eavesdrop on your activities, and steal passwords. If you can, stick to cellular networks.

## Can you use a VPN to watch Netflix and other streaming services?

The war between VPNs and streaming services has heated up. This is a gray area of the law. Despite this, many VPNs market themselves as [great options for streaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-netflix-vpn/) and accessing geo-locked libraries and content.

Using a VPN might go against the terms of service set by streaming service providers. So, while you can stream with a VPN enabled -- although access can change when streaming services block IPs -- it might not always be legal to do so.

**Also**: **[Best VPN for streaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/)** 

## What are simultaneous connections and why should you care?

Simultaneous connections refer to the maximum number of VPN connections you can have at any time. For example, if you're using your smartphone, laptop, and tablet over a VPN at the same time (such as on business trips away), and back home, your partner is using their smartphone, PC, and tablet over the VPN, and you have five simultaneous connections... there might be a problem.

One of your connections won't be private any longer. Having access to more simultaneous connections is a good thing.

## How can I tell if my VPN is working or not?

A fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working correctly, some tools make checking your VPN's performance easy.

You can find out your IP address and location using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). Compare the IP address and location when you're connected with and without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.

 It's also possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. You can run tests on a site like [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to ensure your VPN has no issues with DNS leaks or IP leaks. Plenty of tools allow you to test for leaks, but VPN providers own many, and it may not always be clear who developed the tool, which could be a conflict of interest. You may want to run tests with several different sites and compare the results.

## Does a VPN slow down your internet connection?

Yes. There are some circumstances when it doesn't, but those tend to be rare. Generally speaking, you'll get from 50% to 90% of your real-world speed through a VPN connection, depending on your original location and the country server you select. Remember, the further away your preferred server, the more likely you will experience speed loss.

## Are there any free mobile VPNs?

There are many free VPNs available for mobile devices, but nothing in life is truly free, and you will likely be handing over your data in return for the service. They may also not be trustworthy, may be ad-supported, and may track your online activities.

Free VPNs from trustworthy companies are few and far between. Proton's free VPN is an option we support, although it is limited. Others you might want to explore are listed in our guide.
