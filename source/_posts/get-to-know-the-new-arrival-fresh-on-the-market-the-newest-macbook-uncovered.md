## 13-inch MacBook Pro With M2 Chip

 The[M2 MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/apples-m2-macbook-pro-isnt-the-successor-it-should-be-5496651) is identical to the 13-inch M1 model in every way except for the chip. It even includes a Touch Bar and a headphone jack. The M2 model can be upgraded with more memory and storage, but aside from faster processing, the M1 and M2 models are the same out of the box.

That said, the M2 MacBook Pro is a budget-friendly alternative to the more expensive 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. But think of it more like the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air rather than the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro.  

 Here's an overview of the specs:

* **Chip** : Apple M2, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
* **Memory** : Up to 24GB of unified memory

* **Display** : 13.3-inch Retina display with True Tone technology
* **Ports and charging** : Two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports
