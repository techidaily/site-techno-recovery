## Deciding Between Security & Privacy: Proton VPN Compared to NordVPN on ZDNET

![proton-v-nord](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d0a73c89c87db64ee6bc96fe0c900e568822d4d1/2024/09/12/8c59e5b1-1e74-4552-bcec-f607e235d0b8/proton-v-nord.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

[Proton VPN](https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=25&aff%5Fid=4706&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&aff%5Fid=307&source=ZDNET&offer%5Fid=378) are hands-down among the most secure VPNs available. Comparing the two head-on can be challenging, but some notable performance differences can make you choose one over the other.

If you're looking for a VPN for specific activities, such as [streaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/), NordVPN should be your pick. On the other hand, Proton VPN offers a [free service experience](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) like no other. Both VPNs support up to 10 simultaneous devices per account and will cost you almost the same on long-term plans. I closely [tested and examined](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/) different aspects of these two services to help you make a quick decision about which one to buy.

### 1\. You are extra keen on your privacy

[Proton VPN](https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=25&aff%5Fid=4706&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)'s jurisdiction in Switzerland provides maximum protection from third-party interference because of the country's strict data retention regulations. This, coupled with the fact that Switzerland doesn't belong to 5/9/14 Eyes Alliances (countries that freely share the data of internet users) helps to reinforce a transparent no-logs policy. NordVPN is also based in a privacy-friendly location, Panama, but the laws aren't as consumer-centered as in Switzerland.

**Also: [How to use the open-source Proton VPN browser extension](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-the-proton-vpn-browser-extension/)**

Also, Secure Core servers provided by Proton VPN can route traffic in privacy-friendly countries (including Switzerland, Iceland, and Sweden) for enhanced anonymity, such as when torrenting. That said, both Proton and NordVPN offer an assortment of privacy features, including no-logs, leak protection, ad/malware/tracker blockers, and so forth. NordVPN even offers RAM-only servers that frequently delete traces of data left in the servers whenever they reboot.

### 2\. You want a free VPN

Proton VPN tops our [best free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) list, thanks to many valuable features, including fast speeds, unlimited bandwidth, high-end encryption, and a kill switch. This allows you to do more than just browsing without a paid subscription, beating most free services that restrict bandwidth usage and other vital features. Plus, you won't be bothered by ads when using the free app.

NordVPN doesn't have a free version, although Android users can access a limited seven-day free trial via the Google Play Store. You can also test NordVPN and Proton VPN risk-free because they're both backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. Should you decide to upgrade, you can go with either since there isn't a big difference in price. Proton VPN's cheapest subscription is $4.49/month, the same as NordVPN's best plan (with anti-malware and tracker blocker).

### 3\. You want an intuitive VPN for Linux

Both Proton VPN and NordVPN integrate well with most devices and operating systems. Proton VPN, however, provides a more straightforward app for Linux distros (distributed OSs), with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for connecting and changing settings. This is more convenient than NordVPN's Linux app, which can only be controlled via the command line.

Linux users also get a lot of flexibility with Proton VPN, which lets you access most of the advanced features, like an ad blocker, a VPN accelerator (speed booster), and port forwarding.

### 1\. You want fast speed performance in a VPN

Although internet connections are often slower when using a VPN, [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&aff%5Fid=307&source=ZDNET&offer%5Fid=378) is well-optimized to counter speed losses. It's comparatively faster than Proton VPN and only rivaled by ExpressVPN. Proton VPN had slight connection inconsistencies in our tests. It gave the fastest speeds when connected to European servers, while NordVPN performed well in many regions.

NordVPN's proprietary NordLynx protocol delivers speeds close to baseline internet connections. You can easily stream in 4K or play games without much lag. Proton VPN isn't that far behind as it can also give you faster connections anywhere. Just remember to optimize the app's settings, for example by using the WireGuard protocol and turning on the VPN accelerator feature.

### 2\. You want to use your favorite streaming services with a VPN

NordVPN works with geo-restrictions better than Proton VPN. It's reliable for bypassing firewalls that filter VPN traffic on sites like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, ESPN, and many more. We did multiple tests and [selected NordVPN as the best VPN for streaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/), beating rival services including Proton VPN. Both NordVPN and Proton VPN provide obfuscation, a feature that makes it harder for platforms to detect that you're using a VPN. NordVPN seems to access most sites without any challenges.

Besides, NordVPN is compatible with many streaming devices, including Apple TV, which Proton VPN doesn't support. The smart DNS feature allows you to configure DNS settings on devices that don't natively support VPNs, like PlayStation and Xbox, and access geo-blocked content anywhere.

**Also:** [**The fastest VPNs: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-vpn/)

### 3\. You want the best protection for your devices

This might easily be a tie, but we picked NordVPN as the winner after measured considerations. Both VPNs provide secure encryption for browsing online and on Wi-Fi networks, IP leak protection, and specialty servers like Double VPN and Tor/Onion over VPN, among many other features.

Nevertheless, NordVPN has many more robust features and settings than Proton VPN. For example, the Threat Protection Pro tool scans files downloaded on your computer for malware and viruses, blocking potentially dangerous ones. Proton VPN also has a malware blocker, but it doesn't scan offline files.

Dark Web Monitoring is another NordVPN feature that regularly checks whether your email and passwords have been compromised online (by scanning risky websites known for identity scams). This feature is only offered in Proton's password manager service (Proton Pass), not the VPN.

### Is Proton VPN a good VPN?

Yes, Proton VPN is a solid VPN with many advanced features. It has one of the largest server coverage in 112 countries and delivers above-average speeds in most locations. The VPN uses the best data encryption standards and doesn't log your sensitive information, like web searches and IP addresses. Proton VPN is convenient for most online activities, including streaming, torrenting, and lag-free gaming.

### Is Proton VPN better than Surshark?

Proton VPN beats Surfshark in privacy, server coverage, and, in some cases, speed. Surfshark, on the other hand, is reliable for geo-restrictions and supports unlimited simultaneous connections (unlike Proton VPN, which limits you to 10 devices). Surfshark is much cheaper if you're looking for a VPN to use for the long term, while Proton VPN costs less for the short term. Surfshark offers better customer support than Proton VPN. That said, both VPNs are good, and the best one ultimately comes down to what you want to use a VPN for.
