## Choosing the Right Sidekick: A Comparison of the Google Pixel Watch Vs. Apple Watch Series 9

![Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/730b79b28f73620639933cffd94d1f0deb2621b8/2024/08/12/be65f0e2-b603-45e2-8241-8dd8d5aff3c3/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-apple-watch-series-9.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

The Apple Watch Series 9 is arguably the best [smartwatch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/) available for most people today, but it also requires that you use an Apple iPhone. You may want to consider an iPhone if you find the Apple Watch compelling enough. We have a few reasons that you may want to move to iOS.

Google launched the first Pixel Watch in 2022\. The new Pixel Watch 3 is its best yet, with two size options that will appeal to more people. A Google Pixel smartphone is also an incredible smartphone, so if you like the sleek round design of the Pixel Watch 3 better than the square Apple Watch Series 9, you won't be sorry with a Pixel smartphone.

To help you better decide between the two, let's take a look at the key differences below.

##  You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...

June Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. The deep Fitbit and Google integration appeals to you

Google acquired Fitbit in 2021 and has rolled the Fitbit health and wellness features into its Pixel Watch models. With each new Pixel Watch model, the Fitbit features get better. This year, new readiness and cardio load tracking guides should help you with workouts that are optimized for you and your body. Fitbit Premium should provide personalized, AI-powered run recommendations, while the new Fitbit Morning Brief should deliver a health and wellness summary when you wake up.

**Also: [I went hands-on with Google Pixel Watch 3: These three best features make a difference](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-google-pixel-watch-3-these-three-best-features-make-a-difference/)**

The promise of a full Google watch finally starts to become more of a reality with improved Google integration. This integration includes Nest camera and doorbell streams, Google TV remote functionality, offline Google Maps, and improved Google Assistant call handling.

###  2\. You own an Android smartphone

In years past, Google's wearable operating system supported iPhone use, letting you choose from many Android-based wearables no matter which phone operating system you were using. That changed a couple of years ago, so if you want to use a Google Pixel Watch, you need to connect it to an Android smartphone.

**Also: [How to preorder the new Pixel Watch 3, and the best deals so far](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-pixel-watch-3/)**

You don't need a Google Pixel phone to use a Google Pixel Watch, though, so you can pick up a fairly affordable Android smartphone if you really want to use a Pixel Watch 3.

###  3\. You like the smooth pebble design

Although the first two Pixel Watch models were too small for my wrist, I loved the round, subtle design and am pleased to see Google continue with that same form factor. It stands apart from other watches that embrace a more traditional watch case and bezel. The smooth round watch makes it easy to wear while sleeping, which may lead to better sleep data results.

**Also: [Google Pixel Watch 3 vs Pixel Watch 2: Should you upgrade?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2-should-you-upgrade/)**

The design does leave the glass display unprotected, so if you are someone who is known for knocking their wrist against walls and other objects, then the Pixel Watch 3 may not be the best option for you. If you want an elegant, simple design, however, you will love the continued Pixel Watch design language.

###  1\. Reliable gesture control appeals to you

Apple recently added gestures with the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, and unlike some other watches with gesture support, they work reliably. The one-handed quick double pinch is fantastic for checking the Smart Stack and scrolling while your other hand is carrying things or otherwise occupied.

**Also: [The best Apple Watches you can buy: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/)**

You can answer calls, view messages from a notification, capture a photo with your iPhone while using the Camera Remote app, or snooze an alarm with gestures on an Apple Watch.

###  2\. You want to use lots of third-party apps

Google can't beat Apple when it comes to third-party application support. In every type of app recommendation list I have made, more of the apps I regularly use are available on an Apple Watch than a Pixel Watch.

**Also: [Apple Watch Series 9 review: Why I'm not settling for the less expensive models in 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/)**

In addition to the vast number of applications available, developers tend to launch first on the Apple Watch, so new apps usually appear on WatchOS first. Some of the applications even make the Apple Watch Series 9 function better than a smartphone did just a few years ago.

###  3\. You want the best heart rate sensor on a watch

Every smartwatch today has an integrated heart rate sensor, and the Apple Watch stands proudly above them all in terms of accuracy and reliability. Rob ter Horst, [The Quantified Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/@TheQuantifiedScientist), has tested a vast number of wearables. If you check out his video and charts, Apple Watch models are always at the top of the list for heart rate performance.

The heart rate sensor is key to the health and wellness features, including sleep and activity tracking. It's nice to have an accurate heart rate sensor right on your wrist, as it means you won't have to wear a separate heart rate strap on your arm or chest. If you like to ride a bike and track your workout, you can mount your iPhone on the handlebars and have your Apple Watch heart rate measurements appear right on your iPhone display.

### BEST GOOGLE ALTERNATIVE

## Google Pixel Watch 2

You can save a bit of money on last year's model with very few compromises in capabilities. The Google Pixel Watch 2 works closely with Fitbit for fitness and health tracking, too.

### BEST RUGGED SMARTWATCH ALTERNATIVE

## Apple Watch Ultra 2

If you are looking for a larger Apple Watch with a bigger display and a longer battery life, then you might want to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2\. It's twice the price of the Series 9, but some of us think it is worth the price.
