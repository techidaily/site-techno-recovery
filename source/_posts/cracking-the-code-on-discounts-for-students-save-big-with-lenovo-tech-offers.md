## Cracking the Code on Discounts for Students: Save Big with Lenovo Tech Offers
 Lenovo is one of the biggest names in desktop and laptop computers, with popular brands like Thinkpad and Ideapad. If you can prove your enrollment at a qualifying institution, you can save as much as 20 percent on Lenovo laptops through the official Lenovo store.

 Lenovo also offers discounts to military personnel, teachers, and senior citizens.

## How to Sign Up for the Lenovo Student Discount

 Since Lenovo uses ID.me to verify your enrollment, you need to either sign up for an ID.me account and set it up before or, as shown below, create it while shopping for a deal.

 After you create and set up this account, you can use it for other sites that use ID.me without any additional work.

 ID.me provides verification for teachers, first responders, government employees, and members of the armed forces. Signing up once grants you access to discounts from other businesses.

1. Navigate to the[ID.me Student Discounts page](https://shop.id.me/student) and use the search bar to search for Lenovo deals.

## How to Use Your Lenovo Student Discount

 You can also go directly to the Lenovo student discount page once you have an established ID.me account.  

1. Navigate to the[Lenovo Students & Teachers Discounts](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flandingpage%2Fstudents-and-teachers%2F) page. Select**Shop Now** .

2. Determine which model you want, and select**Add to Cart** . If prompted, choose**Add to Cart** a second time to finalize the process and view your cart.  
![Add To Cart option when shopping on the Lenovo site](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6gzTYV8Uyp1xG0HDlCDNfX4Z2oI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/009_lenovo-student-discount-4686110-e7dae007e58e4dd6a6ceb1a6d29dccbf.jpg)
3. Select**Verify with ID.me** .  
![Verify with ID.me option from the Lenovo checkout page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tGcuTqwcnNqG8Z9NcRer7BWoVCM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/010_lenovo-student-discount-4686110-6149068fc06b484a8952af3ef8cb2f9c.jpg)
4. Choose**Student** , then click**Continue to sign in** .  
 You can also sign in to ID.me with your Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn account.  
![Signing in with ID.me verification from the Lenovo site](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r_6sBdz0n93hZOaY79xRHLhmtL4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/011_lenovo-student-discount-4686110-772fd44d9c9e4bc7ac1d701bbff832fe.jpg)  
 If you haven't set up your ID.me account, you're prompted to verify your enrollment. If you are verified, ID.me passes that information to Lenovo to unlock your discount.
5. Verify that your discount has been applied and complete your purchase.  
 The Lenovo student discount functions like a coupon code that you apply when you check out and buy your items. Instead of entering a coupon code, after you enter your ID.me information, ID.me verifies that you are a student, and Lenovo provides you with a discount.

* At least 18 years old.
* Currently enrolled at a college, university, community college, or technical college.

## What Does the Lenovo Student Discount Get You?

 The Lenovo student discount provides a five to 20 percent discount on big name brands like Thinkpad and Ideapad. There isn't a standard discount amount, but you can view the currently available deals by visiting the Lenovo College Deals page.

 Lenovo applies discounts in the shopping cart after verifying that you are a student. You won't see the discount reflected in the Lenovo website's prices.

## How Does Lenovo Verify Student Enrollment?

 Lenovo uses an identity verification service called ID.me to check your enrollment as a qualifying institution student. This service verifies enrollment at four-year universities, junior and community colleges, and technical colleges.

 When ID.me can't automatically verify your enrollment, you can upload supporting documentation. For this process to work, you'll need to scan your documents for students at ID.me to go through manually.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What to Do When Automatic Verification Fails

 Since Lenovo uses ID.me to check your status as a student, the verification process is usually automated and painless. When the process fails, upload your supporting documentation to access your student discount.

 Here are some of the types of proof that ID.me accepts:

* A current student ID card with a visible expiration date.
* A transcript showing current enrollment.
* An enrollment verification letter from the Office of the Registrar at your school.

 If you still can't access the student discount, even after providing documentation manually,[contact ID.me customer support](https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/202858654-I-couldn-t-resolve-my-problem-using-FAQs-How-can-I-reach-ID-me-for-additional-help-) for additional assistance. Someone may need to process your application manually.

## What Happens to Your Lenovo Student Discount When You Graduate?

 The Lenovo student discount is only available if you're enrolled at an accredited school, which is the same as the[Spotify student discount](https://www.lifewire.com/spotify-student-discount-4684465) . If you graduate or leave school, you're no longer eligible for the discount.
