## Seamless Google Home Experience on Your Personal Computer: A Comprehensive Walkthrough
### What to Know

* There isn't a Google Home app for Windows. An Android emulator is one way to open the full app on a PC.
* Chrome can be used to control playback and cast from a computer. This doesn't let you set up the devices.
* A third option is Google Home for Web. This is a stripped-down, web version that shows cameras and routines.

 This article explains all your options for using Google Home on a Windows PC. While the app is designed to work only with a mobile device, other options include an Android emulator, the Chrome browser, and the Google Home website.

## Use Google Home on a PC With an Android Emulator

 An[Android emulator for Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-emulators-4175015) is one way to run Android apps like Google Home on a PC.[BlueStacks](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-bluestacks-to-run-android-apps-on-windows-4770053) (pictured below) is one choice. It shows the full app, including all your devices, Routine automations, activity logs, and settings.  

![The Google Home app on a PC via the BlueStacks emulator](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z1DLkZVzMbSewj5CFcMxJpxahlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/google-home-app-pc-bluestacks-d37d00e604e5487c81147f0f14436876.png)

 In our tests, we were able to receive motion alerts for a camera, but we couldn't control lights or add a new device.

 One thing to note about using an emulator to run Google Home on Windows is that you need one that supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for full functionality. For example, if you want to set up a new device, Bluetooth is necessary.

## Use Google Chrome to Control Google Home Devices

 Google Chrome mimics some of the functionality of the Google Home app, but it's limited. For example, you can't use it to set up Google Home devices. However, you can[use Chrome to cast to your Google Home devices](https://www.lifewire.com/use-chromecast-to-show-windows-desktop-4129536) , such as a speaker or Chromecast.

[Update to the latest version of Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-chrome-4690369) and verify that your PC and Google Home device[connect to the same Wi-Fi network](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-google-home-to-wi-fi-4159401) . To control a device, select the **three vertical dots** in the upper-right corner of Chrome, select**Save and share** \>**Cast** , and then select the device.

 Some websites, like YouTube and other popular video and music streaming services, offer built-in cast buttons that stream media to your Google Home device. This button is usually positioned near the playback controls.

## View Google Home Cameras From a PC

 Google Home is also available through the website.[Visit home.google.com](https://home.google.com/) from your PC to view any cameras that are already installed and set up in your account. Controls are limited, but you can turn off the camera, listen and speak through it, and view recorded events.

 Google Home for Web also lets you access all your household routines. You can't[add new routines](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-google-home-routines-4687252) from here, but you can trigger any that you built from the mobile app.

## Can You Control All Google Home Devices From Your PC?

 With an emulator, you have full access to all Google Home features, provided that the emulator can access the same network your devices are installed on. Unfortunately, some of the most popular Android emulators either don't include that functionality or are hard to configure.

 The Cast option in Chrome is unable to set up new devices, but it's great for playing and pausing media and displaying a browser tab or your whole desktop on the TV.

 Google Home for Web is the most limited of the three options. There are no Wi-Fi controls, devices can't be set up from scratch, you won't see activity logs, and non-camera devices like speakers, lights, and other smart home tech aren't accessible.

 It is also possible to[install Google Assistant on Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/google-assistant-on-windows-4628292) to take full advantage of Google's virtual assistant. However, voice support is limited to streaming media from Chrome to Google Home devicesâ€”you'll only enjoy a few simple commands, such as_Stop_ and_Max volume_ .
