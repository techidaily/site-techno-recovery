## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Remarks to Directories in Windows 11

If you want to organize your files and folders, Windows offers many options. But did you know you can add comments to folders on Windows 11? It's a great way to mark important files to help them stand out, and avoids the need to give your folders lengthy names. Here's how to do it.

##  How to Enable the Comments Column in File Explorer

 The Comments column is disabled by default in File Explorer, so you need to enable it before you add comments.

 To do this, open File Explorer and go to the folder you wish to comment on. Click "View" in the toolbar and select "Details". This changes the view mode and shows various columns.

 Next, right-click any column and select "More" from the options.

 From the Choose Details window, check "Comments" and click "OK".

 Now you can view the Comments column in File Explorer.

##  How to Add Comments to Folders in Windows 11

 To add comments to folders, you have to complete the following process for each folder individually.

###  Step 1: Customize the Folder

 You need to [add a custom icon to the folder](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/resolving-msiexecexe-is-not-found-and-other-msi-dll-problems/) that you want to add a comment to. This helps with viewing the hidden desktop.ini file inside the folder, which you need to edit later.

 To begin, right-click the folder and select "Properties".

 This is undoubtedly a cumbersome process for what you would expect to be a simple task, but unfortunately there isn't an easier native method. Perhaps Microsoft will improve this functionality in a future Windows 11 update.
