[Limits on trial version of Epubor Ultimate?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 2/5/2021 10:55:46 AM 

You offer a 30-day free trial of Epubor Ultimate. What limits are there on the use of the trial version? (I want to test conversion of up to 5 AZW3 files that are locked by DRM before comitting to purchase).

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
). 

[What are limitation of the trial version?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/26/2021 12:19:30 AM 

I attempted to test a conversion of a Kindle eBook to PDF and of the 496 pages, only 25 pages converted and that did not include the cover. Are there limitations to the trial version? I really want to make sure this program is going to convert all pages before determine if it's worth purchasing.

Hi,  
 I would really buy your product, but with the free trial, i have noticed that some words in the text are not well transformed. Sometimes there are some weird characters.  
 For this reason I would like to ask you a temporarly trial for the full conversion.   
 thank you very much   
 Sincerely  
 Marta

I have been using othre free DRM removal software, but it is outdated.  
 I attempt the free trial version of epubor ultimate before buying.After loading encrypted file in ADE, I loaded the file in ADE digital edition folder to epibor U.  
 Seems to work fine, (conversion to epub succeeded).  
 But uploading the file to Googple Pay does not work.  
 What could be wrong?

[iDoes the free trial have limitations?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/28/2021 2:10:27 AM 

I downloaded and installed the free version. I started to convert an ebook to Word. After 60 pages the conversion stopped.

[KFX to ...](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 8/12/2023 3:49:29 AM 

I tried to convert a KFX file to pdf and was somewhat successful with the trial version and reverting PC Kindle to an old version. That being said the 'sample' text that I was given looked like garbage. Just a very basic sample of 20% of the text that was converted, which is fine as a sample, but I don't want to invest in the full version if what is going to be given to me looks so bad. Does the full converted file retain any of the books formatting or cover photos, etc.? Or will it just be a basic text conversion that looks like it was written in note pad?

[ePub conversion not generating 20% with Ultimate trial](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 12/7/2023 10:16:25 PM 

Hi, I have tried to convert a couple of Kindle downloads to epub in with my Epubor Ultimate for Mac trial. The converted epub files only contain two pages for each book I have converted and the pages are random and incomplete. Is this normal? I am looking forward to purchasing the licensed version but the sample conversions don't instill much confidence given the unusual output. Please advise.
