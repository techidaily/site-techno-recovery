## Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station

### Best MagSafe 3-1 wireless charger

Anker's MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station for iPhone is still a wireless charging dream almost 7 months after my initial purchase. This MagSafe charger features 15W charging, offers a stand component for my iPhone 14 Pro, charges all of my Apple devices at once, and folds up easily for quick transport and storage. It also comes with a wall adapter, which isn't always a guarantee. 

**Also:** [**I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-found-a-qi2-charging-station-that-can-do-it-all-and-apple-users-will-love-it/)

I first purchased this Anker charger after ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz tested it in March of last year. I was looking for a safe and functional 3-1 charger that would also cut down the amount of cords I needed to pack while traveling. This is it. Unveiled at CES 2023, this 3-1 is truly worth your money if you own an Apple Watch and a pair of AirPods too and want a great charger for at home and on the go. Ortiz said that the charging speed on this charger is comparable to individual cords with respective wall adapters, even when charging simultaneously. "Whether I was charging one device or three, I noticed that the devices were charging at a comparable speed to when I normally had them plugged into their respective wall chargers," she said in her review. 

I can concur based on my personal use, too. This stand charges up all of my devices quickly, and I love how easy it is to pack up to take on a trip. I've personally taken this charger in carry-on bags on the plane, and in travel bags in the car, and it makes setting up your charging station at a hotel that much easier. You're also never going to forget a charging cable ever again, because all you need is this little device. 

Even though this Anker charger is on the pricier side, costing $110, it's worth it thanks to its function and duality. It also frequently goes on sale during Amazon events, dropping to $88 (save $22). Compared to other options on this list, I think this 3-1 pick offers immense value because it can be used at home or on the go with ease, especially if you can grab it on sale. 

Verified Amazon customers give this Anker charger a 4.6/5 stars and said they liked the compactness and convenience of this design as well as the easy to use setup, foldability, and magnetic strength. However, some customers said the simultaneous charging wasn't consistent. 

_Author's Note: The Anker MagGo 3-1 charger is on sale for $88 (save $22) at Amazon upon the latest publication._

Pros 
* Works with several devices
* "Luxury" color and material options
* Aesthetic
* Wall adapter included

Cons 
* Must double check device is placed correctly to charge
* No watch charging option for Apple
* Movement can disrupt charge
* Pricey for only 2-1 charging

## Courant Catch 2 Wireless Charger

### Best Android and Apple wireless charger for aesthetics

The Courant Catch 2 is designed to charge through most cases up to 3mm in thickness with Qi-certified technology. Courant says it offers "multi-device wireless charging, without any of the drawbacks of 'dead-zones'." 

This charger has made its way across many of my social media feeds over the years, and I have always been intrigued by the blend of style and function. I was happy to finally test some of Courant's products and was overall impressed with the aesthetic appearance and charging capabilities. While this isn't the fastest charger on the market, it's not designed to be so. Rather, Courant has chosen to focus on making tech beautiful, which in the accessory category, isn't a pillar of many competitors. The Catch 2 is truly one of the most appealing and beautiful mobile accessories I have ever used, and for that alone is worthy of praise. 

But what's more is that it does charge well. This comfortably charged my iPhone 14 Pro and my AirPods Pro 2 with ease, and they looked quite nice while doing so. Even the included wall adapter and cord carry the carefully thought-out aesthetics of the charging pad, matching perfectly in color. This charging pad is only a 2-1 option but is compatible with more smartphone options than our top pick (you can wirelessly charge any device that supports wireless charging). The only negative I experienced as an iPhone user is the lack of MagSafe technology (though keep in mind this wasn't designed to include a magnetic grip), because it does take extra effort to check to make sure my devices are in fact charging when I place them on the pad. They also can easily be disrupted by charging with movement, as I discovered when my cats began jumping on tables. Of course, there's no Apple Watch charger on this pad either. 

That said, if you're looking for a beautiful yet functional charger for your living space, bedroom, or "drop zone" area of your home, this Courant charger fits the bill. It comes in both linen and leather options with several color choices, each to fit your style perfectly. If you're a MagSafe maestro, Courant does offer a MagSafe wireless charging tray option that is designed to charge an iPhone and a pair of AirPods at the same time, but not in this specific design iteration, and it will cost you a bit more. 

The Catch 2 charger has a 4/5 star ranking on Courant's website, and customers said that they liked the overall design and aesthetic appeal of this charger, as well as the numerous color options. One customer even said it was the missing piece in their office: "This might be the best tech equipment I've gotten since my AirPods. Sleek design with high functionality, this was the missing link in my office. Looks beautiful on my dark desk - gorgeous contrast." However, some customers said this version wasn't ideal for charging two iPhones wirelessly and that without a magnetic connection, you must be vigilant about placing your devices down to ensure they charge.

[View now at QDOS](https://www.qdossound.com/products/snapstand-3-in-1-wireless-charger-space-grey)

Pros 
* Stand feature
* 3-1 charging
* Unique, flat-fold design
* Easy for travel
* Standby mode compatible

Cons 
* No color options
* Pricier compared to other 3-1 options
* No wall adapter included
* iPhone only

## Qdos SnapStand 3-1 Wireless Charger

### Best 3-1 MagSafe wireless charger for travel

There's lots of functional (yet funky) wireless chargers on this list, but the Qdos SnapStand 3-1 wireless charger is by far the funkiest. This MagSafe charger offers 15W fast charging, and can charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, and iPhone simultaneously. The unique stacked ring design easily folds down flat for quick (and space-saving) transportation, and allows your iPhone to chill in standby mode when turned 90 degrees. 

Although there are other 3-1 options on this list, only a few are foldable, and only this Qdos charger folds like this. Much like the Courant charger's unique material and design, the Qdos brings its own standout aesthetic to the table (literally). While expanded to allow for 3-1 charging, this wireless charger resembles something along the sorts of an industrial stand and, while compact, something along the lines of a compressed stage. It's so compact, that it fits in the back of my jean pocket (though it does protrude outwards). It's just as easy to toss in a bag for traveling as the Anker 3-1; it just offers a much different approach to the same desired functionality. 

When I tested the Qdos stand, I liked the 3-1 charging capabilities and the 15W iPhone charging, as well as how portable this design is. I have to give some extra kudos for the design, which is unlike anything else on this list (or on the market). My only downside to this charger is what it gains in design in lack of colorways, and it would've been really cool to see some more intentional colors to help elevate the overall aesthetic, as Courant did with their Catch 2\. 

**Qdos SnapStand 3-1 Wireless Charger features**: **Compatability**: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | **Color:** Space Grey | Comes with wall adapter | Aesthetic design | Unique, fold-flat design | 60% recycled materials

* 3-1 charging
* Qi2 charging
* Stand design
* Not travel-friendly
* Metal and glass design

Cons 
* Expensive

## Nomad Stand One Max

### Best 3-1 Wireless Charging Stand

If you're looking for a true stand layout for your devices, Nomad's Stand One Max is a ZDNET favorite. Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner prefers this Nomad stand (which is on its 3rd generation) over other options from Belkin, Anker, and more. Nomad brings elevated design and an environmentally conscious mindset to their tech gear. This 3-1 stand features 15W Qi2 charging and a fast Apple Watch charger. 

It's made of weighted metal and glass for a seamless design and is available in two basic colors: white and black. Its handy stand allows your iPhone to rest in StandBy mode, too. Although this Nomad stand features fast charging and three-device charging, its base is still a little larger than other stand configurations on the market due to the side-by-side placement of the iPhone and Apple Watch chargers, but it isn't a downside if you don't mind. If you are looking for more vertical stand configurations, you're going to want to keep your eye out for options that stack their charging components, like the Qdos SnapStand, as opposed to one that places them next to each other. 

Nomad customers love the overall appearance and charging capabilities this wireless charger offers, and it carries a 4/5 star rating on their website. However, some customers reported a loose connection between the charging base and the included USB-C cord. 

**Nomad Stand One Max Wireless Charger features**: **Compatability**: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | **Color:** Carbide or Silver | Supports StandBy mode | Apple Watch Fast Charger | Luxury design |

## Anker MagGo Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger

### Best singular MagSafe wireless charger

Sometimes you just need a single charger. If you're looking for an affordable, easy-to-use, and travel-friendly charger, this MagSafe option from Anker is a great pick. It comes with a 5ft cord which makes it perfect for a bedside or couch side cord, and leverages Qi2 charging for a fast power boost. Charger your iPhone or wirelss earbuds like AirPods (one at a time, of course), without breaking the bank. This MagSafe charger is under $30 and is uber portable, too, but it does not include a wall adapter. 

**Also:** [**This $20 MagSafe charger is better and cheaper than Apple's own accessory**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-20-magsafe-charger-is-better-and-cheaper-than-apples-own-accessory/)

ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes tested this Anker MagSafe charger and was impressed with it's charging rate, compact form, and design enough to purchase a second one for his off-grid setup. He liked it even more than another Anker charger he had been using, too. 

"For $20 you get a modern, high-speed Qi2-certified charger that is as good as anything made by Apple. I've seen a lot of poorer-quality chargers on sale for $20 (and more!), so it's refreshing to have a quality option at a budget price," Kingsley-Hughes says. 

Verified Amazon customers said they liked the functionality and strong magnetic connection of this charger. Several said that they liked the overall value of this Anker charger as well as the generous cord length and simple design. However, some customers said that the charger gets hot (although keep in mind it is normal for chargers to get slightly warm). 

**Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charger features**: **Compatability**: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless earbuds | 5ft cord | Lightweight and compact design | Budget-friendly

## How did we choose these best wireless chargers?

While testing and researching the best wireless chargers, I and other ZDNET members consider key factors like power output, design, connectivity, materials, and price to help guide our decision-making. We've tested every product recommended on this list for its charging capabilities, overall value, and functionality. Many of these picks are our personal charging stations that we use every day, so you can trust that we're not just sharing random products. 

We look for a product that adds value to your life. That is, can you "add" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? 

If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that's why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and your budget and why our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted.

## Factors to consider when choosing a wireless charger:

* **Power:** Most wireless chargers on this list average an output of 15 watts, and many also feature Qi2 fast charging. This means you'll have a pretty speedy experience charging up your devices, but keep in mind some chargers offer less wattage or are not designed to use Qi2 charging. For the most part, if you're looking for a daily charger that will stay at home or in the office, most of these picks will suit your needs. If you're in the market for a quick charger for travel or just because you'll want to lean more towards Qi2 options.
* **Design:** Consider whether you plan to take your wireless charger on the go. If so, a portable, lightweight design may be a better fit for you. Likewise, if this charger will remain on your bedside table or desk, consider how much space you're willing to give up, if you want a vertical or horizontal orientation (ie: stands vs. bases), and how many devices you're wanting to charge at the same time.
* **Connectivity:** Most of these wireless chargers use MagSafe technology, though several options do not. Some chargers also feature added USB-C or USB-A ports to allow for the charging of extra devices. Most importantly, be sure to check what types of charging your phone and other devices support before making a purchase. A MagSafe option won't do you any good if your phone does support it (though remember, you can always [convert your device](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-add-magsafe-to-your-android-phone-and-why-youll-love-it/) into a MagSafe option).
* **Price:** Wireless chargers can vary in price depending on the type of charger you choose. For example, wireless chargers that accommodate multiple devices will likely be more expensive than single-device chargers. Wireless chargers range in price greatly, but most of the picks on this list are around $100 or more, depending on the model you choose. Also consider that wireless chargers are often one-time purchases, at least for a few years, so while they are pricier than cord combinations, it isn't an everyday purchase.

## What is MagSafe?

MagSafe simply refers to a magnetic wireless charging technology developed by Apple. It uses a ring of strong magnets on the back of compatible devices (the iPhone 12 and newer, with some exceptions) to connect to your phone and charge wirelessly. MagSafe also allows you to attach other accessories, like wallets, stands, grips, and more to your phone securely. The point of the magnetic ring is to ensure a perfect alignment for efficient, effective charging and a strong grip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Is MagSafe charging better than cable charging?

It's really up to you. 

Both cable charging and wireless charging boost your phone effectively. But with a cable, you have to make sure you're near an outlet or alternative power source when it comes time to recharge your phone. 

With MagSafe, you can experience wire-free charging at home and even purchase a [battery pack](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-external-battery-pack-magnetic-15-watt/) for power on the go. So if you're a mobile a lot, we recommend a MagSafe battery pack to keep your iPhone charged while you travel. For certain situations or environments, a cable may be preferred. For example, I test MagSafe battery packs when I commute into the office and on the go, and test MagSafe charging stations like those included with this list at home. But I also use a classic Lightning cable and wall adapter combo to charge my phone while I actively use my phone. When I charge my phone, AirPods, and Apple Watch overnight, I use Anker's MagGo 3-1 setup. 

## Do wireless chargers work on all phones?

Yes and no. Most recent phone models within the last few years (including both Apple and Android) offer wireless charging. Most current iPhones, however, also feature MagSafe charging capabilities. It's possible that you may still own a phone that doesn't feature wireless charging, and that's why It's always a good idea to check the specs of your device to ensure wireless charging is an option. Always be sure to pay attention to your make and model while shopping for any type of charger, both wired and wireless. 

## I have an Android. Can I use MagSafe?

Android devices do not come with MagSafe built into them since MagSafe technology is a feature developed and implemented by Apple in their devices. This used to be a major disadvantage of not owning an iPhone. However, now there's plenty of options now available on the market to rig your own [MagSafe system with an Android device](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-add-magsafe-to-your-android-phone-and-why-youll-love-it/) thanks to phone cases, accessories, add-on magnetic rings, and more.

## Do wireless chargers come with everything I need to charge?

Yes and no. In my testing experience, wireless chargers do not often come with a wall adapter in the box. If you have an extra on hand, this won't be an issue, but it will be an added expense for most people, especially if the particular setup requires a larger wattage adapter. Keep this in mind while you shop. However, a few picks on this list truly come with the entire wireless charging setup, including the wall adapter, like the Courant Catch 2\.

## Are there alternative wireless chargers worth considering?

The mobile accessory market is full of wireless charging options both for Apple and Android devices. While some only offer dual charging capabilities, others can charge a smartwatch, smartphone, and wireless earbuds at the same time. You can also find wireless chargers at several price points and with more or less aesthetic appeal. Just keep in mind that the most important thing is using a charger that's certified and from a reputable brand. Using cheap chargers may sometimes lead to long-term harm on your device. Here's a few more wireless chargers to consider, all of which are ZDNET-tested.

[Best alternative MagSafe 3-1 Wireless Charging Stand Journey MagSafe Wireless Charging Stand Journey is a sleeper brand in the tech space that has several products I've come to really enjoy.
