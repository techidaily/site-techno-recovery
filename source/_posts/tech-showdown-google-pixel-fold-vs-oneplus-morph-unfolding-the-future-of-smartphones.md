Google just unveiled its new foldable smartphone, the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15878900-1723532402000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and it's already making waves in an increasingly crowded foldable market this year. As the successor to last year's [Pixel Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-fold-review/), the new model has an all-new design, upgraded specs, and a ton of AI chops in tow.

**Also:** [**Everything announced at Made by Google 2024: Pixel 9 Pro, Fold, Gemini, Watch 3, and more**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Everything%20announced%20at%20Made%20by%20Google%202024:%20Pixel%209%20Pro,%20Fold,%20Gemini,%20Watch%203,%20and%20more%22%7D)

One such foldable that's vying for attention is the [OnePlus Open](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-open&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), one of our favorite phones we praised for its powerful software and slim form factor. 

But is it better than the new Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold? With similar designs, price points, and feature sets, you'll likely be considering both of these phones. The question is: which one is best for you? Let's take a look.

## You should buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold if…  

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. You want the best camera system on a foldable

There's no doubt that OnePlus did a great job with the camera system on the OnePlus Open, but those who want some of the _best_ cameras on any foldable will want to check out the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-four-best-features-that-make-it-the-foldable-phone-to-beat/).

The 48MP main lens, 10.5MP ultra-wide, and 10.8MP telephoto all offer similar hardware performance to the previous Pixel Fold and are each backed up by Google's impressive photo processing chops. You also get solid 4K video recording and sharp selfies thanks to the dual 10MP selfie cameras. 

**Also: [I went hands-on with Google's $1,799 Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I'm ready to switch from Samsung](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-googles-1799-pixel-9-pro-fold-and-im-ready-to-switch-from-samsung/)**

Plus, Google packs in all of the smart features that users love, like Night Sight, astrophotography, [Magic Editor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/magic-editor-and-other-ai-features-in-google-photos-are-coming-to-your-phone-for-free/), [Magic Eraser](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-magic-eraser-on-the-google-pixel/), Action Pan, and new features such as [Add Me](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-the-google-pixel-9-pros-add-me-feature-and-found-it-crazy-clever/), which lets you add individual people to a single photo.

The OnePlus Open has solid shooting hardware with its 48MP primary camera, 64MP telephoto, and 48MP ultra-wide, but the results don't quite hold up with what the Pixel can do. Between the two, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the phone you should get if you care about camera quality.

### 2\. You're ready to hop on the AI bandwagon

Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that Google has gone full steam ahead when it comes to integrating AI into its devices. [The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is no exception](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-four-best-features-that-make-it-the-foldable-phone-to-beat/).

The phone ships with Gemini built-in, the replacement for Google Assistant, which uses advanced machine learning to be more insightful and useful than ever before. Plus, you get [Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-three-ai-features-sold-me-on-the-google-pixel-9-pro-and-theyre-very-clever/), two new apps that use Gemini's AI to analyze and sort through your screenshots and generate customizable images on the fly.

**Also:** [**Gemini Live is finally available. Here's how you can access it (and why you'll want to)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gemini-live-is-finally-available-heres-how-you-can-access-it-and-why-youll-want-to/)

The OnePlus Open, meanwhile, doesn't lean into AI. In fact, the farthest you can go with AI on the Open is by installing [Gemini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-google-gemini/) or [ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) as a separate app. There's no system-level integration, and OnePlus doesn't seem interested in that stuff, at least not yet. 

With these AI features and more to come, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the device to get if you want to embrace the incoming AI future.

### 3\. You want better water resistance

The OnePlus Open received an IPX4 for water resistance, which means you can lightly splash it, and it'll survive. But if you're particularly worried about getting your phone wet, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a higher chance of surviving thanks to its stronger IPX8 certification, which means it'll survive in up to a meter and a half of water for 30 minutes.

**Also: [These three AI features sold me on the Google Pixel 9 Pro - and they're very clever](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-three-ai-features-sold-me-on-the-google-pixel-9-pro-and-theyre-very-clever/)**

While both phones are still delicate since they fold in half, water resistance is getting much better on these devices, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has some of the best on the market.

### 4\. You want a future-proofed phone

OnePlus promises to deliver four years of significant software upgrades and five years of security patches with the Open. That's okay, but Google has a sweeter deal with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Google provides seven years of updates on the 9 Pro Fold, which means you'll get access to all the newest features until at least 2031\. It makes Google's offering the phone to get if you want to get the most use out of your next phone possible.

## You should buy the OnePlus Open if…

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. You need multitasking power  

The [OnePlus Open](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-open&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) is perhaps the best phone for multitasking that's ever existed, and it's all thanks to the software.

OnePlus introduced Open Canvas with this phone, allowing you to run three apps simultaneously in separate panels and slide between them whenever you want. You can also bring up more apps in floating windows, pull up a floating taskbar to jump between apps, access recently used files, and more. It all works exceptionally well, too, taking full advantage of the big display to help you finish your work on the go.

**Also: [OnePlus Open Apex Edition hands-on: Easily the best-looking foldable phone I've seen](https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-open-apex-edition-hands-on-easily-the-best-looking-foldable-phone-ive-seen/)**

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold can't hold a candle to this. While you can run apps in split-screen mode and pull up a floating taskbar, you don't get the same ease of switching between apps or floating app windows as you do with Open Canvas. OnePlus somehow upstaged Google in the software department, which is something you can almost never say. 

### 2\. You want longer battery life and faster charging

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

The OnePlus Open has a 4,805mAh battery that can easily last a full day and then some on a charge. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a smaller 4,650mAh cell, which isn't great if you need the most battery you can get in your next phone.

**Also: [The OnePlus Open is getting a red 'Crimson Shadow' variant, and I'm worried for Samsung](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-oneplus-open-is-getting-a-red-crimson-shadow-variant-and-im-worried-for-samsung/)**

When you look at charging speed, things get even more compelling for the OnePlus phone. While Google has increased the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's speed to 45W, the OnePlus Open supports 67W fast charging, giving you enough juice to get through the day in around 10-20 minutes, which is insane. The best part? The Open has the required charger in the box, whereas the Pixel forces you to buy Google's new 45W charger separately.

### 3\. You need a ton of storage

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes with 256GB or 512GB of storage. While that may be enough for most people, those who need the most storage possible will want to pick up the OnePlus Open. That phone can be configured with up to 1TB of storage, which is both great for a smartphone and the perfect amount for those who need as much room as possible for all the random videos and files they collect over the years.

### 4\. You want to save money

June Wan/ZDNET

This one's simple: if you want to save money, buy the OnePlus Open. It's currently [on sale for $1,399](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-open&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) \-- that's $300 off the regular price -- while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799\. Plus, you can trade in any phone through [OnePlus.com](https://www.oneplus.com) and instantly get $200+ off, reducing the price further. At that point, the Open becomes an insanely good value and perfect for those who don't want to spend nearly $2,000 on their next phone.
