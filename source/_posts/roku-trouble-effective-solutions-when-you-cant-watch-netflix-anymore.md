 With their coming-of-age ceremonies quickly approaching, lifelong friends Stacy (Sunny Sandler) and Lydia (Samantha Lorraine) begin to feud over boys and who will have the bigger bat mitzvah.  

_You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah_ is a more grown-up Adam Sandler movie than say,_The Waterboy_ , but it's targeted toward young adults like his daughter (who plays the lead role).

 Miguel, Bobby, and Luis are a bunch of normal teens with an unusual problem—vampires have invaded their Bronx community and are eating their neighbors.
