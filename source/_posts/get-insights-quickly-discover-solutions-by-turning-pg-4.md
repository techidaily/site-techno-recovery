[No longer supporting this?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/4/2016 5:53:38 AM 

I bought a lifetime license. I have had several reformats of my system and need a new unlock code. And this probably won't be the last time  
 I am getting ZERO response from tech support. Chats aren't answered, Tickets don't have numbers, emails are never answered.  
 I payed ahead in good faith and would like that good faith to be respected  
 Thanks
