Have you ever gone to download a file from Google Drive, only to be prevented from doing so? Every so often I'll make a change to my browser privacy settings, only to find it can no longer download the files I need. It's frustrating because I know it's going to happen when I make the change; I just forget how sensitive Google Drive is to such issues.

You'd think, by now, I'd have learned my lesson. And yet, it happened to me again today. Out of nowhere, I go to download a file from Drive (forgetting I made a change to my browser's privacy settings yesterday) and, lo and behold, Drive refuses to allow me to download the file (a file I created, nonetheless).

What's the problem? Cookies.

Argh! It's always cookies.

## How to fix the Google Drive download issue

How do you fix the problem? It's easy. I'll demonstrate on a Chromium-based browser, which is based on Chrome, because Chrome is the most widely-used browser on the planet. 

**Also:** [**How to automatically convert Google Drive uploads into to Docs format**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-automatically-convert-google-drive-uploads-to-docs-format/)

If you use a browser that is not based on Chrome, the basic idea will apply and you shouldn't have any problem translating the fix to your browser of choice.

## Requirements

In order to solve this issue, the only things you'll need are a valid Google account and a Chrome-based browser (such as [Sidekick](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/this-might-be-my-new-favorite-web-browser/), Opera, Vivaldi, and Edge). That's it. Let's fix this problem.

## 1\. Open your browser

The first thing to do is open your browser of choice. Of course, if you're reading this, your browser is already open -- so you're already one step ahead of the game.

## 2\. Open Settings

Click the three-dot menu button in the upper right corner and select Settings from the resulting menu.

## 3\. Go to Privacy & Security

Chances are, if you suddenly can't download files from Google Drive, something was changed in your Privacy & Security settings. For me, I configured my browser to block third-party cookies. 

**Also:** [**How to organize your Google Drive with these 5 tips**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-organize-your-google-drive-with-these-5-tips/) 

If you did the same thing, you can (and should) keep blocking those third-party cookies. However, what you need to do is add an exception for Google Drive.

You should block third-party cookies on your browser, even if it causes problems like this.

## 4\. Add an exception for Google Drive

Under Customized behaviors, click Add. In the resulting popup, type drive.google.com in the Site field, click the checkbox for Including third-party cookies on this site, and click Add. Once you've taken care of that, close the Settings tab.

Adding an exception to the third-party cookie blocking policy.

If you find any other sites that are not behaving as expected (after you've set your browser to block third-party cookies), add an exception for that address and it should go back to functioning as normal.

Although this can be a hassle, it's better to block third-party cookies and make exceptions as needed in order to better protect your privacy.
